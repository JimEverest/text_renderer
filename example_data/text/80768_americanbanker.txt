The
name
for
a
convention
used
to
express
the
rate
of
prepayments
for
an
asset-backed
security.
ABS
expresses
principal
prepayments
as
a
percentage
of
the
original
number
of
loans
or
contracts
in
the
pool
of
securitized
loans
that
created
the
security.
ABS
is
always
expressed
as
a
monthly
rate.

Abstract
of
title
A
written
report
summarizing
the
history
of
title
transactions
and
conditions
of
title
that
affect
a
given
piece
of
land
covering
the
period
from
the
present
back
to
a
date
in
the
past.
A
comprehensive,
but
cumbersome,
and
somewhat
obsolete,
method
of
verifying
the

Accelerated
depreciation
A
group
of
methods
for
achieving
periodic
reductions
in
the
book
value
of
fixed
assets
that
make
larger
reductions
in
the
early
periods
and
progressively
smaller
reductions
in
later
periods.
The
offsetting
entry
is
the
depreciation
expense.
Acceleration
Making
demand
for
payment
in
full
for
a
debt
that
has
not
yet
matured.
Usually
a
remedy
provided
in
a
loan
document
for
the
lender
to
use
in
the
event
of
default
by
the
borrower.
Acceleration
clause
A
provision
in
a
loan
document
stating
that
the
entire
amount
of
unpaid
indebtedness
owed
to
the
lender
may
become
immediately
due
and
payable
if
the
borrower
defaults.
Acceptance
A
time
draft
that
has
been
accepted
for
payment.
See
banker's

Accessions
Goods
that
are
physically
united
with
other
goods
in
such
a
manner
that
the
identity
of
the
original
goods
is
not
lost.
An
example
is
a
new

Accommodation
maker
Name
used
to
refer
to
a
co-maker
who
agrees
to
sign
a
note
to
induce
the
lender
to
make
a

Account
analysis
An
analysis
performed
to
determine
the
profitability
of
each
demand
account
to
the
bank.
The
analysis
may
also
be
used
to
determine
the
profitability
of
a
group
of
demand
accounts
with
the
same
owner.
Account
analysis
is
normally
performed
by
the
bank,
but
can
be
done
by
anyone
in
the
depositor's
organization
provided
sufficient
information
is
available.
The
analysis
identifies
the
net
earnings
based
on
the
average
daily
ledger
balance
less
reserved
requirements
and
float.
The
net
earnings
can
then
be
compared
with
the
various
activity
service
charges
based
on
the
volume
of
transactions
and
the
per
item
price
of
the
services.
Account
control
agreement
An
agreement
perfecting
a
creditor's
interest
in
a
securities
account
while
allowing
the
securities
to
remain
registered
in
the
name
of
the
owner.
An
account
control
agreement
is
used
to
establish
a
security
interest
conforming
to
the
requirements
set
forth
in
the
UCC.
Account
debtor
An
individual
or
business
that
is
obligated
to
pay
on
an
account,
chattel
paper,
contract
right,
or
general
intangible.
Account
reconciliation
services
A
cash
management
service.
One
or
more
of
a
series
of
bank
services
designed
to
aid
a
deposit
customer
in
the
reconciliation
of
its
bank
account
balance.
A
basic
account
reconciliation
service
may
simply
be
a
listing
of
paid
checks
in
serial
number
order.
More
advanced
account
reconciliation
services
combine
electronic
data
provided
by
the
customer
with
the
bank's
records
to
reconcile
completely
the
account
and
list
all
outstanding
items.
Many
variations
exist.
Also
called
account
recs,
ARPs,
or
recons.
Accounts
A
category
of
personal
property
defined
by
Article
9
of
the
UCC.
Under
the
pre-2000
version
of
Article
9,
an
account
is
a
right
to
receive
payment
for
goods
sold
or
leased,
or
for
services
rendered,
where
these
rights
are
not
evidenced
by
an
instrument
or
by
chattel
paper.
Under
the
revised
Article
9,
the
definition
of
accounts
is
much
broader.
The
revised
definition
covers
a
much
wider
variety
of
payment
obligations,
whether
or
not
earned
by
performance,
including
license
fees
payable
for
the
use
of
software,
credit
card
receivables,
and
healthcare
insurance
receivables.
Accounts
payable
A
category
of
liabilities
that
represents
funds
due
to
creditors.
Usually,
accounts
payable
is
due
to
trade
creditors
who
have
supplied
goods
or
services
without
requiring
immediate
payment.
Accounts
payable
is
sometimes
simply
called
payables.
Accounts
payable
to
trade
creditors
are
sometimes
called
accounts
payable
trade,
due
to
trade,
or
trade
payables.
Accounts
receivable
An
asset
account
that
reflects
amounts
due
from
private
persons
or
organizations
for
goods
and
services
furnished.
For
corporations,
accounts
receivable
excludes
funds
due
from
departments,
but
may
include
funds
due
from
affiliates.
For
governments
and
nonprofit
organizations
using
fund
accounting,
it
does
not
include
funds
due
from
other
funds
owned
by
the
same
entity.
A
category
of
personal
property
defined
by
Article
9
of
the
UCC.
Accounts
receivable
is
the
right
to
receive
payment
for
goods
sold
or
leased
or
for
services
rendered
where
those
rights
are
not
evidenced
by
an
instrument
or
by
chattel
paper.
Accounts
receivable
-
trade
Also
called
trade
receivables.
Amounts
due
from
the
credit
sales
of
goods
or
services
that
are
not
evidenced
by
promissory
notes.
Accreting
swap
An
interest
rate
swap
with
an
increasing
notional
amount.
Accretion
The
process
of
making
incremental,
periodic
increases
in
the
book
or
carrying
value
of
an
asset.
For
example,
when
a
bond
is
purchased
at
a
price
below
100,
the
difference
between
the
purchase
price
and
the
par
value,
the
discount,
is
accreted.
Discounts
are
usually
accreted
in
roughly
equal
amounts
that
completely
eliminate
the
discount
by
the
time
that
the
bond
has
matured,
or
by
the
call
date,
if
applicable.

Accrual
basis
See
accrual
convention.
Accrual
bond
(1)
Bonds
that
pay
the
investor
an
above-market
coupon
rate
as
long
as
a
reference
rate
is
between
preset
levels
established
at
the
time
the
security
is
issued.
A
type
of
structured
note.
Also
called
range
bonds.
(2)
A
type
of
CMO
security
that
does
not
pay
holders
periodic
interest
in
cash.
Instead,
periodic
interest
for
these
bonds
is
accrued.
It
is
added
to
the
principal
amount
due
to
the
holder
at
a
later
date.
See
Z
tranche.
Accrual
convention
Method
used
by
investors
for
counting
the
number
of
days
in
each
month
and
in
the
year.
Also
called
accrual
basis
or
day
basis.
The
accrual
convention
is
expressed
in
different
ways.
An
accrual
basis
of
30/360
indicates
that
every
month
is
treated
as
if
it
was
30
days
long
and
a
year
is
assumed
to
have
360
days.
Accrual
basis
of
actual/360
indicates
that
each
month
is
treated
using
its
actual
number
of
days
while
a
year
is
assumed
to
have
360
days.
Day
basis
of
actual/actual
indicates
that
the
true
number
of
days
for
each
month
and
year
are
used.
The
accrual
convention
is
used
in
the
calculation
of
the
amount
of
interest
payable
on
bonds,
loans,
deposits,
and
other
financial
instruments
on
the
interest
payment
dates.
This
convention
is
also
used
for
the
purpose
of
calculating
accrued
interest
due
from
a
buyer
to
a
seller
of
a
security
sold
between
interest
payment
dates.
Accrued
interest
Interest
that
has
been
earned
but
not
yet
paid.
For
example,
the
interest
earned
by
a
bondholder
between
semiannual
coupon
payments
or
the
interest
earned
by
a
lender
since
the
last
monthly
interest
payment
was
collected
from
the
borrower.
Accrued
interest
for
investment
securities
is
calculated
from
the
issue
date
or
the
last
payment
date
up
to
but
not
including
the
settlement
date.
When
a
buyer
purchases
a
bond,
the
buyer
owes
the
seller
the
accrued
interest
in
addition
to
the
market
price
of
the
security
purchased.
Accumulated
benefit
obligation
(ABO)
The
actuarial
present
value
of
the
pension
benefits
earned
to
date.
Measurement
of
the
accumulated
benefit
obligation
uses
the
historical
compensation
rates
for
pay-related
benefit
plans.
The
ABO
must
be
disclosed
in
a
footnote
to
the
financial
statements.
Accumulated
depreciation
The
total
of
the
periodic
reductions
for
depreciation
in
fixed
assets.
Also
called
allowance
for
depreciation.

Active
tranche
A
REMIC
tranche
that
is
currently
paying
principal
payments
to
its
owners.
Actual

Adjustable-rate
mortgage
(ARM)
A
loan
for
which
the
interest
rate
(coupon
rate)
is
adjusted
periodically
to
reflect
changes
in
a
previously
selected
index
rate.
ARMs
may
have
caps
and
floors
that
limit
the
annual
and/or
the
lifetime
change
in
the
coupon
rate.
Adjusted
duration
See
option-adjusted
duration.
Adjusted
trading
A
practice
used
to
sell
securities
without
recognizing
any
or
all
of
the
true
loss
from
that
sale.
To
hide
the
loss,
the
investor
agrees
to
overpay
for
a
newly
purchased
security
in
exchange
for
the
broker/dealer's
agreement
to
overpay
for
the
security
that
the
investor
wants
to
sell.
The
broker/dealer
incurs
a
loss
by
purchasing
the
investor's
underwater
bond
at
an
above-market
price.
At
the
same
time,
the
broker/dealer
offsets
that
loss
by
selling
the
investor
a
new
bond
at
an
above-market
price.
Thus
the
transactions
are
completely
neutral
from
the
broker/dealer's
perspective.
However,
from
the
investor's
perspective,
the
transactions
effectively
defer
the
recognition
of
losses
on
the
security
sold
by
establishing
an
excessively
high
book
value
for
the
security
purchased.
These
transactions
are
specifically
prohibited
for
federally
insured
financial
institutions.
They
may
also
be
illegal.
Sometimes
called
fee
trading.
Administered
rates
Interest
rates
that
the
bank
or
other
payer
is
contractually
permitted
to
change
at
any
time
and
by
any
amount.
For
example,
the
rates
paid
on
savings
accounts.
All
interest
rates
can
be
categorized
as
either
fixed,
administered,
or
floating.
Rates
that
may
change
at
the
payer's
discretion
are
sometimes
called
variable
rates,
easily
confused
with
floating
rates,
which
change
at
contractually
specified
times
by
contractually
specified
amounts
-
a
very
different
arrangement.
Administrative
float
Float
resulting
from
the
time
it
takes
to
administratively
process
checks
or
other
related
paperwork.
Total
elapsed
time
for
processing
checks
can
range
from
less
than
a
day
to
more
than
a
week.
Note
that
its
basic
elements
are
present
whether
the
work
is
done
by
the
owner
of
the
funds
or
the
work
is
done
by
a
bank
or
other
lockbox
vendor.
Sometimes
referred
to
as
payment
processing
float
or
internal
float,
but
since
some
of
the
sources
of
the
float
delay
are
not
necessarily
internal,
the
term
internal
float
is
not
a
completely
accurate
synonym.
Administrative
review
One
of
two
types
of
real
estate
appraisal
reviews.
Administrative
reviews
focus
primarily
on
the
underwriting
issues
addressed
in
the
appraisal.
These
reviews,
usually
performed
by
the
loan
officer,
approach
the
appraisal
from
a
loan
underwriting
point
of
view.
Typical
issues
addressed
in
an
administrative
review
include:
How
comparable
are
the
comparable
properties
used
in
the
appraisal?
How
reasonable
are
income
and
expense
projections?
Is
the
capitalization
rate
appropriate?

technical
review.

Advance
formula
A
provision
sometimes
used
in
lines
of
credit
as
a
sublimit
on
the
maximum
amount
that
can
be
borrowed.
Typically,
an
advance
formula
limits
the
amount
that
can
be
borrowed
under
a
line
of
credit
to
the
lesser
of
the
amount
of
the
line
or
some
percent
of
accounts
receivable
collateral.
Advanced
Measurement
Approaches
(AMA)
One
of
three
methods
for
quantifying
capital
required
for
operational
risk
under
proposed
Basel
II
capital
rules.
Banks
using
the
Advanced
Measurement
Approaches
must
hold
capital
for
operational
risk
based
on
a
risk
quantity
generated
by
the
bank's
internal
measurement
procedures.
The
most
common
internal
methods
are
self-assessments.

Advances
Funds
received
for
goods
or
services
prior
to
the
delivery
of
the
goods
or
services.
Typically,
the
funds
must
be
returned
if
the
transaction
is
canceled
or
if
the
recipient
of
the
advance
fails
to
provide
the
goods

Amortization
(1)
The
process
of
making
regular,
periodic
decreases
in
the
book
or
carrying
value
of
an
asset.
For
example,
when
a
bond
is
purchased
at
a
price
above
100,
the
difference
between
the
purchase
price
and
the
par
value,
the
premium,
is
amortized.
Premiums
are
usually
amortized
in
roughly
equal
amounts
that
completely
eliminate
the
premium
by
the
time
that
the
bond
has
matured
or
by
the
call
date,
if
applicable.
(2)
Liquidation
of
a
loan
or
security
by
means
of
periodic
reductions.
The
principal
amount
of
loans
is
amortized
by
the
periodic,
usually
monthly,
payment
of
a
fraction
of
the
principal
calculated
to
repay
the
entire
amount
of
principal
due
by
the
date
of
the
last
scheduled
periodic
payment.
Amortization
methods
differ
based
upon
the
type
of
loan.
Mortgage
loans
and
securities
usually
have
level
payments
of
principal
and
interest.
For
such
amortizations,
the
interest
consumes
most
of
the
early
payments
and,
therefore,
principal
amortization
increases
as
the
loan
ages.
Many
business
loans
use
a
level
amortization
with
roughly
equal
principal
reductions
from
each
periodic
payment.
Amortization
period
For
financial
instruments,
the
time
from
the
inception
of
a
loan
or
investment
instrument
with
scheduled
principal
repayments
to
the
due
date
of
the
final
contractually
obligated
principal
repayment.
For
fixed
assets,
the
period
from
the
acquisition
of
a
fixed
asset
to
the
date
of
the
last
periodic
reduction
(made
to
reflect
depreciation)
of
the
book
value
of
that
asset.
(Assets
may
be
depreciated
until
the
book
value
is
zero,
but
sometimes
are
only
depreciated
until
the
book
value
is
reduced
to
an
assumed
salvage
value.)

Anticipated
income
doctrine
of
liquidity
An
explanation
of
bank
liquidity
developed
by
Herbert
Prochnow,
in
which
the
net
cash
flow
of
bank
borrowers,
rather
than
subsequent
new
borrowings,
is
seen
as
the
true
source
of
loan
repayments.
Accordingly,
to
the
extent
that
loans
are
written
with
payment
terms
and
maturities
that
reflect
the
borrower's
cash
flow
stream,
the
cash
flow
to
the
bank
from
loan
principal
payments
is
the
source
of
bank
liquidity.

Appraisal
A
statement
or
estimate
of
the

or
real

Under
the
federal
appraisal
regulations
for
real
estate
pledged
to
secure
loans,
the
term
"appraisal"
refers
to
a

of
market
value
that
meets
the
five
specific
standards.

Arbitrage
(1)
In
theory,
arbitrage
is
the
simultaneous
purchase
and
sale
of
two
identical
commodities
or
instruments
to
take
advantage
of
price
variations
in
different
markets.
For
example,
the
purchase
of
gold
in
London
and
the
simultaneous
sale
of
gold
in
New
York.
(2)
In
practice,
the
term
is
used
to
refer
to
the
simultaneous
purchase
and
sale
of
any
two
contracts
or
commodities
with
largely
offsetting
risks.
For
example,
the
purchase
of
two-year
Treasuries
and
the
sale
of
futures
contracts
for
an
equivalent
amount.

Arbitrage
CDO
A
CDO
whose
purpose
is
to

There
is
no
"arbitrage"
in
the
classic
sense
of
the
word.
Rather,
equity

hope
to
capture

Asset-backed
security
(ABS)
A
debt
security
collateralized
by
assets.
Created
from
the
securitization
of
any
loans.
(1)
The
phrase
may
describe
the
broad
category
that
includes
named
subcategories
such
as
securitized
residential
mortgage
loans
(RMBS)
and
securitized
commercial
mortgage
loans
(CMBS).
(2)
The
phrase
directly
names,
asset
backed
securities
created
from
consumer
installment
or
credit
card
loans.
(3)
Securitized
commercial
(non-consumer)
obligations
not
secured
by
real
estate
are
typically
called
collateralized
debt
obligations
or
CDOs.
CDOs
are
sometimes
defined
to
be
a
subset
of
ABSs.
ABSs
may
be
structured
in
a
variety
of
ways
including
simple
"pass
through"
structures
and
complex,
"multi-tranche"
structures.
The
value
that
ABSs
provide
to
investors
is
comprised
of
the
cash
flows
due
to
the
ABS
holders
from
the
underlying
loans.
ABS
issues
are
typically
structured
so
that
the
bankruptcy
or
insolvency
of
an
underlying
borrower
does
not
impact
the
cash
flow
received
by
the
security
owner.

Asset
sensitive
Describes
an
entity's
position
when
an
increase
in
interest
rates
will
help
the
entity
and
a
decrease
in
interest
rates
will
hurt
the
entity.
An
entity
is
asset
sensitive
when
the
impact
of
the
change
in
its
assets
is
larger
than
the
impact
of
the
change
in
its
liabilities
after
a
change
in
prevailing
interest
rates.
This
occurs
when
either
the
timing
or
the
amount
of
the

changes
for
liabilities
causes
interest
expense
to
change
by
more
than
the
change
in
interest
income.
The
impact
of
a
change
in
prevailing
interest
rates
may
be
measured
in
terms
of
the
change
in
the
value
of
assets
and
liabilities.
In
that
case,
an
asset-sensitive
entity's
economic
value
of
equity
increases
when
prevailing
rates
rise
or
declines
when
prevailing
rates
fall.
Alternatively,
the
impact
of
a
change
in
prevailing
rates
may
be
measured
in
terms
of
the
change
in
the
interest
income
and
expense
for
assets
and
liabilities.
In
that
case,
an
asset-sensitive
entity's
earnings
or
net
income
increases
when
prevailing
rates
rise
and
declines
when
prevailing

fall.
Asset/liability
management
committee
(ALCO)
A
committee,
usually
comprising
senior
managers,
responsible
for
managing
assets
and
liabilities
to
maximize
income
and
safety
over
the
long
run.
In
a
financial
institution,
the
ALCO
is
usually
responsible
for
asset
and
liability
distribution,
asset
and
liability
pricing,
balance
sheet
size,
funding,
spread
management,
and
interest
rate
sensitivity
management.
Usually
used
somewhat
redundantly,
as
in
ALCO
committee.
Asset/liability
management
(ALM)
Coordinated
management
of
all
of
the
financial
risks
inherent
in
the
business
conducted
by
a
financial
institution.
The
process
of
balancing
the
management
of
separate
types
of
financial
risk
to
achieve
desired
objectives
while
operating
within
predetermined,
prudent
risk
limits.
Accomplishing
that
task
requires
coordinated
management
of
assets,
liabilities,
capital,
and
off-balance
sheet
positions.
Therefore,
in
the
broadest
sense
of
the
term,
ALM
is
simply
the
harmonious
management
of
cash,
loans,
investments,
fixed
assets,
deposits,
short-term
borrowings,
long-term
borrowings,
capital,
and
off-balance
sheet
commitments.
However,
in
practice,
the
term
is
often
used
to
refer
to
segments
of
that
broader
definition
such
as
only
interest
rate
risk
management
or
only
interest
rate
and
liquidity
risk
management.

Assets
repriced
before
liabilities
A
measure
of
the
gap
between
the
quantity
of
assets
repricing
and
the
quantity
of
liabilities
repricing
within
a
given
period
of
time.
A
simple
measure
of
a
financial
institution's
exposure
to
beneficial
or
adverse
consequences
from
changes
in
prevailing
interest
rates.
Assignee
The
party
to
whom
an
assignment
is
made.
Assignment
Transfer
of
any
contractual
agreement
between
two
parties.
One
of
the
parties,
the
assignor,
transfers
its
rights
or
obligations
to
another
party,
the
assignee.
If
interests
in
assets
of
the
assignor
are
assigned,
the
assignment
transfers
all
or
some
of
the
rights
of
ownership
to
the
assignee.
If
interests
in
obligations
of
the
assignor
are
assigned,
the
assignor
is
totally
or
partially
absolved
from
further
performance.
Lenders
sometimes
see
leased
property
assigned
from
the
original
lessor
to
another
party
who
then
pledges
them
to
the
bank
as
collateral
for
a
loan.
For
personal
property
collateral,
a
secured
party
may
enter
an
assignment
of
its
security
interest
into
the
public
record
by
using
a
standard
form
called
UCC-3.

interest
in
land
contract
A
document
used
when
a
borrower
is
purchasing
real
estate
over
time
under
an
article
of
agreement
or
land
contract.
The
document
assigns
the

document
used
in
real
estate
loans
when
the
mortgaged
property
is
leased
to
third-party
tenants.
If
the
borrower
defaults,
the
assignment
of
lease
and
rentals
gives
the
lender
the
right
to
receive
rents
from
the
tenants
and
to
transfer
the
leases
to
a
subsequent
purchaser
of
the

under
which
it
is
being
sold
over
time
to
a
third
party.
If
the
borrower
defaults,
the
assignment
of
the
land
contract
gives
the
lender
the
right
to
receive
payments
from
the
buyer

Assumable
As
applied
to
mortgage
loans,
assumable
means
that
a
borrower
who
sells
his
or
her
home
may
transfer
the
outstanding
mortgage
loan
secured
by
that
dwelling

to
conduct
business
that
is
different
from
the
legal
name
of
the
proprietorship,
partnership
or
corporation.
Sometimes
an
assumed
name
is
prefaced
by
the
initials
"t/a"
for
"trading
as"
or
"d.b.a."
for
"doing

Asymmetric
behavior
Unbalanced
behavior
exhibited
by
financial
instruments,
the
rates
or
values
of
which
do
not
change
in
proportion
to
changes
in
market
rates.
For
example,
increases
in
the
prime
rate
quickly
reflect
most
or
all
of
increases
in
prevailing
interest
rates,
while
decreases
in
the
prime
rate
are
slow
to
reflect
decreases
in
prevailing
interest
rates.

the
spot
price,
of
an

Attachment
A
procedure
established
by
Article
9
of
the
UCC.
Creditors
must
comply
with
this
procedure
in
order
to
obtain
a
security
interest
in
property
owned
by
a
debtor.
Alternatively
or
in
addition,
the
process
may
be
used
to
give
the
creditor
a
security
interest
in
property
owned
by
a
guarantor
or
by
another
third
party.
Often,
attachment
alone
is
not
sufficient
to
establish
the
priority
of
the
creditor's
interest
relative
to
the
interests
of
other
creditors.

Attrition
analysis
Evaluation
of
the
reduction
in
the
amount
of
an
asset
or
liability
held.
For
example,
an

of
the
reduction

Audited
statements
The
most
reliable
type
of
financial
statements.
The
audit
is
based
on
information
submitted
by
the
client,
and
the
CPA
does
not
verify
all
of
the
information.
Limits
on
the
scope
of
the
audit
and
on
the
CPA's
responsibility
are
described
in
the
opinion
letter
that
accompanies
the
audited
statements.
However,
the
value
of
an
audited
statement
is
that
the
independent
CPA
is
responsible
for
testing
and
verifying
any
numbers
that
seem
questionable
or
unusual
as
well
as
the
most
material
financial
information.
For
example,
if
a
firm
has
a
material
amount
of
accounts
receivable,
the
auditor
will
typically
confirm
at
least
a
sample
of
those
accounts.
If
a
firm
has
a
material
amount
of
inventory,
the
auditor
will
typically
perform
a
physical
verification
of
that
inventory.
Authenticated
security
agreement
A
electronic
security
agreement
between
the
debtor
and
the
bank
that
is
accepted
by
the
borrower
either
by
downloading
the
agreement
into
a
personal
database
or
by
printing
a
copy.
As
an
alternative
to
a
security
agreement
physically
signed
by
the
debtor,
the
2000
amendments
to
the
UCC
provide
for
an
authenticated
security
agreement.
Authority
A
government
or
public
agency
created
to
perform
a
single
function
or
a
restricted
group
of
related
activities.
Usually,
such
units
are
financed
from
service
charges,
fees,
and
tolls,
but
in
some
instances
they
also
have
taxing
powers.
An
authority
may
be
completely
independent
of
or
partially
dependent
upon
other
governments
for
its
financing
or
the
exercise
of
certain
powers.
Automated
clearinghouse
(ACH)
The
ACH
network
is
a
nationwide
electronic
funds
transfer
system
for
participating
depository
financial
institutions.
The
American
Clearing
House
Association,
Electronic
Payments
Network,
Federal
Reserve
and
Visa
act
as
ACH
Operators,
central
clearing
facilities
through
which
financial
institutions
transmit
or
receive
ACH
debits
and
credits.
The
ACH
network
serves
20,000
financial
institutions,
3
million
businesses,
and
100
million
individuals.
The
ACH
Network
is
commonly
used
for
direct
deposit
of
payroll
and
government
benefits
such
as
Social
Security,
direct
payment
of
consumer
bills,
business-to-business
payments,
federal
tax
payments,
and,
increasingly,
e-commerce
payments.
In
2000
there
were
6.9
billion
ACH
payments
made
worth
more
than
$20
trillion.

Automatic
stay
An
injunction
that
automatically
becomes
effective
upon
the
filing
of
any
bankruptcy
proceeding.
The
stay
precludes
creditors
from
taking
action
against
the
debtor
or
the
debtor's
property.
In
Chapter
12
or
13
bankruptcy
proceedings,
the
automatic
stay
also
applies
to
co-obligors
and
guarantors.
Availability
The
condition
in
which
deposited
funds
are
available
for
use
by
the
depositor.
The
time
lag
between
the
date
of
a
deposit
and
the
date
it
is
credited
to
the
collected
balance.
Availability
schedule
A
schedule
that
determines
when
each
bank
in
the
check-clearing
process
will
receive
credit
and
when
the
depositor
of
checks
will
be
able
to
withdraw
or
invest
the
funds.
The
schedule
sets
a
standard
time
period
since
each
check
cannot
be
individually
traced
through
the
check-clearing
process.
Every
major
bank
publishes
its
availability
schedule
based
on
its
location
and
on
the
location
of
the
bank
on
which
the
check
is
drawn.
Available
balance
The
balance
in
an
account
that
can
be
invested
or
withdrawn.
Available
balance
refers
to
the
bank
ledger
balances
less
checks
in
the
process
of
collection.
Also
called
collected
balances,

funds.
Available-for-sale
(AFS)
One
of
three
defined
categories
established
in
FAS
115
for
the
classification
of
financial
instruments
held
as
assets
on
the
books
of
an
investor.
Available-for-sale,
or
AFS,
securities
are
securities
that
the
investor
is
unable
or
unwilling
to
commit
to
hold
to
maturity.
Designation
of
a
security
as
AFS
does
not
mean
that
the
investor
plans
to
sell
it
prior
to
maturity.
FAS
115
requires
investors
to
report
unrealized
gains
or
losses
in
AFS
securities
as
changes
in
reported
equity.

cash
flows.
See

life.
Average
daily
balance
The
average
daily
balance
is
a
method
used
to
calculate
finance
charges.
It
is
calculated
by
adding
the
outstanding
balance
on
each
day
in
the
billing
period,
and
dividing
that
total
by
the
number
of
days
in
the
billing
period.
The
calculation
includes
new
purchases
and
payments.

Back-end
load
A
form
of
sales
charge
imposed
on
investors
by
some
mutual
funds.
These
charges
may
be
called
back-end
loads,
deferred
loads,
deferred
sales
charges,
contingent
deferred
sales
charge
(CDSC),
or
redemption
fees.
Regardless
of
the
name,
funds
with
deferred
sales
charges
are
simply
one
form
of
load
funds.
These
funds
offer
investors
the
opportunity
of
paying
a
sales
charge
later
rather
than
paying
one
at
the
time
of
purchase.
The
main
advantage
is
that
earnings
from
the
investment
in
a
deferred
charge
fund
are
paid
on
the
full
amount
of
the
investor’s
principal.
In
contrast,
earnings
in
a
fund
with
an
front-end
load
are
only
paid
on
the
net
amount
of
the
investor’s
principal
after
the
front-end
charge
is
deducted.
A
second,
potentially
significant,
advantage,
is
that
deferred
sales
charges
often
decrease
as
the
investor’s
holding
period
lengthens.
See
front-end
load,
load,
and
no-load.
Backlog
Unfilled

Backtesting
Back-testing
In
general,
the
process
of
comparing
predictions
from
a
forecasting
model
to
observable
data.
A
model
may
be
run
using
historical
inputs
after
which
the
mode's
forecast
is
compared
to
the
actual
outcomes
observed
for
the
forecasted
period.
In
practice,
either
final
model
outputs
or
intermediate
calculations
may
be
backtested.
Backtesting
is
often
inexact
because
of
the
impact
of
extraneous
events
on
the
observable
data.
Bad

or
quantities
of
liabilities
to
groups
or
quantities
of
assets.
Sometimes
described
as
the
identification
of
"mini-banks"
within
the
bank.
Balloon
loan
A
loan
for
which
the
final
payment,
larger
than
all
of
the
previous,
regularly
scheduled
payments,
is
due
in
a
lump
sum
before
the
loan
is
fully
amortized.
The
final
payment
is
called
a
balloon
payment.
Balloon
mortgage
A
mortgage
loan
with
a
balloon
payment.
Typically,
the
balloon
payment
is
due
10
or
15
years
after
the
loan
is
made.
Balloon
payment
A
contractually
required
loan
payment,
almost
always
the
final
payment,
that
is
larger
than
the
other
contractually
required,
periodic
loan
payments.
Results
from
the
fact
that
required,
periodic
loan
payments
are
too
small
to
fully
amortize
the
loan
balance
by
the
maturity
date.
BAN
See

is
expressed
in
terms
of
PSA

Differences
between
predicted
speeds
and
the
actual
speeds
subsequently
experienced
can
cause
bracket

Bank-specific
liquidity
risk
One
of
three
main
types
of
liquidity
need
environments.
The
risk
that
a
bank
might
experience
a
funding
crisis
resulting
when
one
or
more
events
or
problems
applicable
just
to
the
bank
cause
funds
providers
to
lose
confidence
in
the
bank.
Also
know
as
internal
liquidity
risk
or
bank
name

Banker's
acceptance
(BA)
A
short-term
financial
instrument
that
is
the
unconditional
obligation
of
the
accepting
bank.
Banker’s
acceptances,
or
BAs,
arise
from
transactions
involving
the
import,
export,
transit,
or
storage
of
goods,
including
domestic
as
well
as
international
transit.
For
investors,
it
is
very
important
to
realize
that
the
underlying
transaction
that
gives
rise
to
a
BA
is
almost
completely
irrelevant
to
the
credit
quality
or
the
liquidity
of
the
instrument.
The
actual
BA
is
created
at
a
late
stage
in
the
underlying
transaction
when
a
bank
accepts
its
obligation
to
pay
the
holder
of
the
accepted
draft.
In
other
words,
when
the
transaction
becomes
a
BA
it
becomes
an
unconditional
obligation
of
the
accepting
bank.
From
an
investor's
point
of
view,
a
BA
is
a
bank
obligation
that
has
at
least
the
same
credit
strength
as
any
CD
issued
by
the
same
bank.
Typically,
BAs
are
stronger
than
CDs
because,
in
addition
to
the
credit
strength
of
the
accepting
bank,
BAs
are
backed
by
the
credit
strength
of
a
drawer;
an
endorsing
bank,
if
one
is
involved
in
the
transaction;
and
usually
by
the
pledge
of
documents
representing
ownership
of
the
trade
goods
and
insurance
on
the
goods.
BAs
do
not,
however,
carry
federal
deposit
insurance.
BAs
are
considered
safe,
liquid,
short-term
money
market
investments.
For
bank
holders
of
BAs,
an
additional
issue
is
called
eligibility.
See
eligible
banker's
acceptances.

Basel
II
The
common
name
for
capital
guidelines
issued
by
the
Bank
for
International
Settlements
(BIS)
located
in
Basel,
Switzerland.
The
Basel
II
capital
guidelines
replace
previous,
much
simpler,
BIS
guidelines.
The
guidelines
are
developed
by
an
international
committee
of
banking
regulators
and
implemented
by
rules
issued
by
the
national
regulators.
Risks,
under
Basel
II,
are
regulated
in
three
general
ways
called
"pillars".
Pillar
I
calls
for
explicit
capital
allocations.
Credit
risk
and
operations
risk
fall
under
pillar
I.
Pillar
II
calls
for
supervisory
review
of
capital
adequacy.
Interest
rate
risk
and
liquidity
risk
fall
under
pillar
II.
Pillar
III
calls
for
public
disclosure.
All
risks
fall
under
pillar
III.
Basel
III
Revised
capital
and
liquidity
risk
rules
published
by
the
Bank
for
International
Settlements.
The
rules
include
a
quantitative
requirement
called
liquidity
coverage
ratio
(LCR)
and
a
requirement
called
net
stable
funding
ration
(NSFR).
Basic
indicator
approach
One
of
three
methods
for
quantifying
capital
required
for
operational
risk
under
proposed
Basel
II
capital
rules.
Banks
using
the
basic
indicator
approach
must
hold
capital
for
operational
risk
equal
to
the
average
over
the
previous
three
years
of
a
fixed
percentage
of
positive
annual
gross
income.
Based
on
the
questionable
assumptions
that
losses
from
operational
risk
are
closely
proportionate
to
gross
income.

Basis
(1)
The
difference
between
rates
or
prices
of
assets
that
are
related
but
not
identical.
For
example,
the
difference
between
the
cash
price
and
the
futures
price
of
a
security.
Sometimes
called
spread.
(2)
The
difference
between
the
price
of
a
futures
contract
and
the
price
of
the
underlying.
(3)
The
number
of
days
in
a
bond
coupon
period.
See
day
basis.
Basis
point
A
unit
of
measurement
for
interest
rates
or
yields
that
is
expressed
as
a
percentage.
One-hundredth
of
one
percent.
One
hundred
basis
points
equal
one
percent.
Basis
risk
The
risk
to
a
holder
of
financial
instruments
that
a
change
in
prevailing
interest
rates
will
not
affect
the
prices
of
or
yields
on
similar
instruments
in
exactly
equal
amounts.
For
example,
an
increase
in
prevailing
interest
rates
might
raise
3-month
U.S.
Treasury
yields
by
100
basis
points
while
3-month
certificate
of
deposit
yields
go
up
by
only
85
basis
points.
One
of
the
four
primary
components
of
interest
rate
risk.
Sometimes
called
spread
risk.
Basis
swap
A
type
of
interest
rate
swap
in
which
the
net
cash
flows
that
the
parties
agree
to
exchange
are
based
upon
the
differences
between
two
different
interest
rate
indexes.
Banks
use
basis
swaps
to
hedge
basis
risk
by
locking
in
a
net
interest
rate
spread
between
a
variable
rate
cost
of
funds
tied
to
one
index
and
a
variable
rate
asset
tied
to
a
different
index.

maturing
instruments.
Benchmark
(1)
A
standard
of
comparison
used
for
judging
performance.
For
example,
the
return
from
a
bond
portfolio
may
be
compared
to
the
return
from
a
benchmark
instrument
or
portfolio.
In
this
context,
a
nearly
risk-free
benchmark
or
one
that
closely
matches
the
risk
in
the
bond
portfolio
may
be
selected.
(2)
The
process
of
comparing
a
forecast
or
simulation
to
a
standard
for
the
purpose
of
evaluating
the
accuracy
of
the
forecast
or
simulation.
For
example,
the
forecasted
change
in
net
income
projected
by
an
ALM
simulation
model
may
be
benchmarked
by
comparing
that
forecast
to
subsequent
earnings.

that
receives
all
of
the
benefits
or
rights
of
an
owner
of
a
security
even
though
the
legal

is
recorded
in
the
name
of
a
broker
or
a

Beta
A
Greek
letter
used
by
mathematicians
to
label
the
degree
of
sensitivity
to
changes
in
one
variable
to
changes
in
another.
The
name
for
correlation
of
the
changes.
Beta-adjusted
gap
Gap
reports
modified
to
mollify
the
errors
caused
by
basis
risk.
The
essential
concept
of
beta-adjusted
gap
is
that
all
interest
rates
do
not
change
by
the
same
amounts,
but
that
there
is
an
identifiable
relationship,
a
correlation,
between
changes
in
various
interest
rates.
Some
rates
are
more
sensitive
to
change
than
other
rates.
In
beta-adjusted
gap
analysis,
the
volumes
of
assets
and
liabilities
subject
to
repricing
are
weighted
to
reflect
the
historical
sensitivity
of
the
yields
or
costs
of
those
assets
and
liabilities
relative
to
some
benchmark
yield
or
cost.

Bilateral
netting
A
legally
enforceable
arrangement
between
two
parties
to
two
or
more
swaps
that
creates
a
single
legal
obligation
covering
all
of
the
individual
swap
contracts.
This
means
that
the
size
of
the
risk
that
one
party
is
exposed
to
for
the
default
or
insolvency
of
the
counterparty
is
net
of
all
of
the
positive
and
negative
values
of
the
contracts
included
in
the
bilateral
netting
arrangements.
Parties
that
engage
in
numerous
swap
contracts
may
use
bilateral
netting
agreements
to
be
able
to
recognize
only
the
net
sum
of
their
obligations
rather
than
the
gross
total
of
the
individual
swap
contracts.
Bilateral
netting
is
also
used
by
a
party
that
wishes
to
cancel
a
swap
contract,
in
which
case
the
party
can
enter
into
a
new
swap
that
is
an
equal
but
offsetting
swap
with
the
same
counterparty.
The
two
parties
can
then
enter
into
a
bilateral
netting
agreement
under
which
the
two
equal
but
offsetting
swap
contracts
net
to
zero.
Billing
cycle
The
number
of
days
between
statement
dates.
Billing
float
Float
resulting
from
delays
in
billing
or
in
the
payor’s
response
to
those
bills.
For
governments,
can
also
occur
if
payor
taxpayers
drag
their
feet
in
filing
self-assessed
taxes.
When
due
dates
are
fixed,
an
easy
measure
of
billing
float
compares
the
date
paid
to
the
date
due.
Billings
in
excess
of
cost
A
liability
created
under
a
type
of
accrual
accounting
used
when
firms
such
as
contractors
bill
their
customers
in
accounting
periods
for
costs
that
they
incur
in
subsequent
accounting
periods.

Acronym
for
"bank-owned
life
insurance".
Bond
(1)
A
debt
security.
Sometimes
used
only
in
reference
to
long-term
debt
securities.
Sometimes
called
a
fixed-income
security
even
though
many
bonds
have
floating
interest
rates.
(2)
A
guarantee
provided
by
a
surety
or
insurance
company.
For
example,
fidelity
bond,
indemnity
bond,
performance
bond,
or
payment
bond.
bond
anticipation
note
(BAN)
A
short-term
note
sold
by
a
public
entity
that
will
be
repaid
from
the
proceeds
of
an
anticipated
bond
issue.
Bond
equivalent
yield
An
annual
yield,
expressed
as
a
percentage,
describing
the
return
provided
to
bond
holders.
A
bond
equivalent
yield
is
double
the
simple
interest,
semiannual
yield.
Since
Treasury
and
agency
notes
and
bonds,
as
well
as
most
corporate
and
municipal
bonds,
pay
interest
semiannually,
the
bond
equivalent
yield
is
a
way
to
compare
yields
available
from
discount
securities
such
as
Treasury
bills
and
BAs
with
yields
available
from
coupon
securities.
From
that
usage,
this
yield
measure
is
also
known
as
the
coupon
yield
equivalent
or
the
equivalent
bond
yield.
For
securities
that
pay
daily,
monthly,
or
quarterly
interest,
the
bond
equivalent
yield
understates
the
benefits
obtained
from
the
compounding
of
income.
Bond
indenture
A
document
that
sets
forth
the
terms
of
a
bond
issue,
the
obligations
of
a
bond
issuer,
and
the
rights
of
the
bond
holders.
The
bond
indenture
is
a
contract
between
the
company
that
issued
the
bonds
and
the
bond
trustee
acting
on
behalf
of
the
bond
holders.
Bond
indentures
may
include
a
variety
of
provisions
and
thus
define
and
create
the
differences
in
term
and
risk.
Bond
insurance
Credit
support
for
a
bond
or
a
tranche
in
a
multi-tranche
debt
security.
The
credit
support
is
provided
by
an
external,
third
party
-
usually
an
insurance
company
that
specializes
in
financial
guarantees.
Bond
Market
Association
(BMA)
An
industry
trade
organization
for
U.S.
broker/dealers.
Among
other
things,
the
BMA
has
developed
standard
documentation
for
repurchase
agreement
transactions
and
for
describing
prepayments
received
from
MBSs.
Formerly
known
as
the
Public
Securities
Association
(PSA).
Bond
swap
The
simultaneous,
or
nearly
simultaneous,
purchase
of
one
debt
security
with
the
proceeds
from
the
sale
of
another
debt
security.
The
swap
is
done
after
the
investor
has
conducted
an
analysis
showing
that
the
debt
security
being
purchased
has
more
desirable
characteristics
than
the
debt
security
being
sold.
Bond
value
(for
convertible
securities)
See
investment
value
(for
convertible
bonds).
Bonding
(1)
Either
the
process
of
obtaining
or
the
state
of
having
a
fidelity,
indemnity,
performance,
payment,
or
similar
bond.
In
commercial
construction
financing,
bonding
usually
refers
to
a
contractor’s
performance
bond.
For
employees
of
financial
institutions,
bonding
usually
refers
to
fidelity
bonds.

fidelity
bond,
payment
bond
and
performance

Refinancing
short-term
debt
with
long-term
debt
is
sometimes
called
bonding
out.
Book
entry
The
nonphysical
record
of
ownership,
custody,
and
transfer
of
securities
through
electronic
means.
The
system
for
settlement,
delivery,
and
custody
of
uncertificated
securities.
Book
entry
securities
Stocks,
bonds,
other
securities,
and
some
certificates
of
deposit
that
are
purchased,
sold,
and
held
with
only
manual
or
computer
accounting
entries
rather
than
transfers
of
physical
certificates
to
evidence
the
transfer.
Typically,
instead
of
a
physical
certificate
or
instrument,
buyers
only
receive
receipts
or
confirmations
as
evidence
of
their
ownership.
Book
value
The
value
at
which
an
asset
is
carried
and
reported
on
the
owner’s
balance
sheet.
For
debt
securities,
the
current
book
value
may
be
the
purchase
price
plus
accretion
(in
the
case
of
securities
purchased
at
a
discount)
or
the
purchase
price
minus
amortization
(in
the
case
of
securities
purchased
at
a
premium).
Book
value
may
differ,
perhaps
significantly,
from
market
value.
Bootstrapping
For
financial
risk
mangers,
bootstrapping
means
(1)
the
procedure
where
coupon
bonds
are
used
to
generate
the
set
of
zero-coupon
bond
prices,
or
(2)
the
use
of
historical
returns
to
create
an
empirical
probability
distribution
for
returns.
Bootstrapping
is
an
iterative
calculation
technique,
often
used
in
the
construction
of
specialized
time
series.
For
example,
the
calculation
of
forward
rates
from
traditional
yield
curves
uses
an
iterative
process
to
extract
the
implied
rate
for
each
forward
period.
The
term
is
used
in
other
ways
in
other
contexts.
Bow

informal
term
used
to
describe
the
curvature

which
expense
equals

a
financial
instrument
that
just
equals
the
purchase
price
plus
cost
of
carry
for
an
investor
owning
that
instrument.
(4)
The
price
level
of
a
call
option
that
equals
the
sum
of
the
exercise

plus
the
premium
paid
to
acquire
the
option,
or
the
price
level
of
a
put
option
that
equals
the
exercise
price
minus
the
premium.
Break-even
interest
rate
The
maximum
interest
rate
that
a

Break-even
prepayment
rate
The
specific

security
is
equal
to
the
yield
available
from
another
security
to
which
it
is
being
compared.
Break-even
sales
The
minimum
sales
level
that
a
firm
must
achieve
in
order
to
generate
enough
cash
flow
to
make
all
required
principal
and
interest
payments.
Break-even
time
(for
convertible
securities)
The
amount
of
time
before
the
higher
yield
on
the
convertible
bond
compared
to
an
otherwise
similar
nonconvertible
bond
compensates
the
investor
for
the
excess
cost
of
the
convertible
over
the
common
stock.
Usually
calculated
by
using
current
yields
rather

coupon
and
dividend
rates.

from
the
proceeds
of
the

of
an
asset
being
replaced
by
the
asset
just
purchased.
In
consume
loans
bridge

may
be
used
to

the
cons8umer
to
buy
a
new
house
before
selling
her
current
house.
Also
commonly
used

buyouts
and
other
large

Broker
A
party
who
brings
buyers
and
sellers
together.
Brokers
do
not
take
ownership
of
the
property
being
traded,
but
rather
they
are
compensated
by
commissions.
Brokers
are
not
the
same
as
dealers;
however,
the
same
individuals
and
firms
who
act
as
brokers
in
some
transactions
may
act
as
dealers
in
other
transactions.
Brokered
deposits
Bank
deposits
solicited
by
a
third-party
broker.
Usually
but
not
always
deposits
for
some
amount
slightly
below
$250,000
so
that
all
interest
as
well
as
principal
is
covered
by
deposit
insurance.
Brokers
are
typically
paid
a
fee
by
the
depository
bank.
BSA
See
Bank
Secrecy
Act.
Buckets
In
gap
reports,
the
predefined
time
interval
groups
are
often
called
buckets.
The
buckets
can
be
defined
to
represent
whatever
time
units
a
bank
wants
to
see
in
its
gap
reports.
The
time
intervals
can
be
single
months
or
years.
Smaller
buckets,
such
as
one-month
buckets,
give
more
detail,
which
in
turn
can
provide
a
more
accurate
measure
of
interest
rate
risk.
On
the
other
hand,
smaller
buckets
can
require
a
greater
number
of
buckets
to
show
the
interest
rate
risk
far
enough
into
the
future
for
prudent
analysis.
Often,
one-month
buckets
are
used
for
the
first
six
or
twelve
months
with
larger
time
intervals
used
as
buckets
for
later
periods.
Builder’s
risk
insurance
Insurance
covering
perils
resulting
in
loss
caused
by
the
builder's
operations
on
the
borrower's
property.
Usually
required
by
property
owners
and
by
construction
lenders
when
a
contractor
is
hired
to
make
improvements
in
an
existing
building
or
to
construct
a
new
building.
Building
code
Laws,
usually
but
not
always
enacted
by
local
government
units,
that
set
safety
and
fire
protection
standards.
These
codes
affect
the
materials
and
methods
used
in
the
construction
of
buildings.
For
example,
a
code
provision
might
require
sprinkler
systems
in
motel
rooms.
Bulge
Informal
term
used
by
some
lenders
to
describe
a
provision
in
a
line
of
credit
promissory
note
that
allows
for
a
temporary
increase
in
the
maximum
amount
that
can
be
borrowed
under
the
line
of
credit.
A
bulge
is
particularly
suited
to
loans
to
firms
with
seasonal
increases
in
sales.
Bullet
loan
A
name
occasionally
used
to
describe
a
promissory
note
used
for
transactions
that
do
not
require
any
principal
to
be
repaid
until
the
maturity
of
the
note.
Interest
is
usually
due
periodically
prior
to
maturity.
Most
often
used
to
describe
loans
with
time
periods
of
at
least
one
year.
Bullet
security
An
instrument
that
repays
the
full
principal
at
maturity.
Busted
convertible
A
convertible
bond
trading
so
far
below
its
conversion
value
that
it
trades
on
investment
value
alone,
meaning
it
has
value
only
as
a
bond.
It
has
essentially
no
equity
value.
Busted
PAC
Planned
amortization
class
tranches
in
collateralized
mortgage
obligations
for
which
the
companion
or
support
tranche
has
been
completely
retired
by
larger
than
expected
prepayments
from
the
underlying
mortgage
loans.
Because
the
companion
or
support
tranche
is
no
longer
outstanding
and
can
therefore
no
longer
absorb
future
prepayments,
the
maturity
of
the
PAC
tranche(s)
may
be
shorter
than
expected.
See
stressed
PAC.
Butterfly
call
spread
One
of
the
more
well
known
option
trading
strategies.
A
complex
option
trading
strategy
using
puts
and
calls
with
different
maturity
dates
and
different
strike
prices.
An
option
strategy
designed
to
profit
from
stable
or
decreasing
volatility.
Buydown
A
lump
sum
payment
made
to
a
creditor
by
a
borrower
or
a
third
party
to
reduce
the
amount
of
some
or
all
of
the
borrower's
periodic
payments
to
repay
the
indebtedness.
Buy/Sellback
A
form
of
secured,
short-term
investment
in
which
a
security
is
purchased
with
a
simultaneous
agreement
to
sell
it
back
to
the
seller
at
a
future
date.
The
purchase
and
sales
agreements
are
simultaneous
but
the
settlement
dates
for
the
transactions
are
not.
The
purchase
is
a
cash
transaction
while
the
return
sale
is
a
forward
transaction
since
it
occurs
at
a
future
date.
A
buy/sellback
is
very
similar
to
a
reverse
repurchase
agreement,
except
that
in
a
buy/sellback
the
investor
is
compensated
by
the
difference
between
the
purchase
price
and
sales
price
rather
than
by
interest.
Unlike
a
reverse
repurchase
agreement,
a
buy/sellback
probably
does
not
include
a
haircut
or
collateral
margin.
Furthermore,
the
buy/sellback
may
be
treated
differently
in
the
event
of
the
buyer’s
bankruptcy.
Every
transaction
that
is
a
buy/sellback
from
the
buyer/lender’s
point
of
view
is,
by
definition,
a
sell/buyback
from
the
seller/borrower's
point
of
view.
Buyer
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business
A
purchaser
who
buys
inventory
from
a
seller
who
is
in
the
business
of
selling
that
type
of
inventory.

Calendar
spread
An
option
trading
strategy
that
involves
buying
two
calls
or
two
puts
on
the
same
underlying,
but
with
different
maturity
dates.
If
two
call
options
are
used,
the
spread
may
be
referred
to
as
a
calendar
call
spread.
Similarly,
if
two
put
options
are
used,
the
spread
may
be
described
as
a
calendar
put
spread.
When
the
exercise
price
of
the
two
options
is
the
same,
the
calendar
spread
is
described
as
a
horizontal
spread.
When
the
exercise
price
of
the
two
options
is
different,
the
calendar
spread
is
described
as
a
diagonal
spread.
Call
An
option
that
grants
the
holder
the
right
to
purchase
an
instrument
in
the
future
at
a
price
established
today.
The
call
option
gives
the
holder
the
right
but
not
the
obligation
to
purchase
the
underlying
instrument.
Call
date
The
date
on
which
a
call
option
may
be
exercised.
The
date
before
the
contractual
maturity
date
on
which
a
bond
may
be
redeemed
at
the
option
of
its
issuer.
Call
feature
See
call
option.
Call
option
A
contract,
or
a
provision
in
a
contract,
that
gives
its
holder
the
right
to
buy
an
underlying
security,
commodity,
or
currency
before
a
certain
date.
The
option
to
purchase
is
for
a
predetermined
price
called
the
strike
price.
When
the
call
option
is
a
provision
in
a
contract
defining
a
transaction
such
as
a
bond
or
a
loan,
it
is
sometimes
called
a
call
feature.
Options
are
often
used
in
hedging.
Call
or
calling
Making
demand
for
payment
in
full
of
a
loan,
usually
a
loan
that
is
in
default,
Often
referred
to
as
calling
the
loan.
Call
price
The
price
at
which
a
call
option
may
be
exercised.
For
example,
the
price
that
an
issuer
is
required
to
pay
in
order
to
redeem
a
bond
before
its
maturity.
Call
protection
A
feature
of
a
bond
issue
that
protects
investors
from
risk
of
prepayment.
In
mortgage-backed
bonds,
call
protection
may
take
the
form
of
prepayment
penalties
or
lock-in
periods.
A
lock-in
period
is
a
time
period,
starting
from
the
issue
date
and
ending
at
a
specified
subsequent
date,
during
which
an
otherwise
callable
bond
may
not
be
called.
This
time
period
is
specified
in
the
bond’s
indenture
agreement.
The
call
protection
period
may
be
a
few
months
or
as
long
as
25
years.
For
convertible
bonds,
see
hard
call
protection
and
soft
call
protection
(for
convertible
bonds).
Call
risk
The
risk
that
declining
interest
rates
will
create
an
economic
incentive
for
the
owner
of
a
call
option
to
exercise
that
option.
In
MBSs,
call
risk
is
the
risk
that
declining
interest
rates
will
accelerate
prepayment
of
the
underlying
mortgage
loans
and
thereby
shorten
the
life
of
the
investment.
Callable
bond
A
bond
that
the
issuer
has
the
right
to
redeem
prior
to
maturity.
Some
callable
bonds
may
be
redeemed
on
a
single
call
date
while
others
have
multiple
call
dates.
Some
callable
bonds
may
be
redeemed
at
par
while
others
can
only
be
redeemed
at
a
premium.
Callable
swap

receive
fixed/pay
floating
interest-rated

cancel
the
swap
prior
to
its
maturity.
CAMEL
An
acronym
for
the
institution
composite
rating
system
used
by
the
federal
regulators
during
a
regulatory
examination.
The
evaluation
is
based
on
Capital,

Cap
An
upper
limit
for
a
variable,
such
as
the
upper
limit
on
the
interest
rate
paid
or
received
in
a
transaction.
For
example,
an
adjustable-rate
mortgage
may
have
a
cap
of
10
percent.
In
this
case,
the
rate
can
adjust
however
the
loan
terms
provide,
without
exceeding
10
percent.
Also
called
a
ceiling.
Cap
is
often
used
with
its
converse,
a
floor.
A
cap
may
be
an
embedded
option,
such
as
the
cap
on
the
rate
for
a
floating
rate
loan,
or
a
stand-alone
option
contract.
Cap

Capital
(1)
Usually
refers
to
the
total
of
the
equity
accounts
in

are
common
and
preferred
stock,
surplus,
and
undivided
profits.
For
other
corporations,
equity
accounts
are
common
and
preferred
stock,
surplus,
and
retained
earnings.
For
bank
capital,
see
tier
1
capital
and

Sometimes
used
as
a
synonym
for
common
stock,
as

stock.
Capital
appreciation
bond
(CAB)
Securities
that
are
issued
at
par,
but
which
do
not
remit
interest
to
the
holder
until
maturity.
The
interest
accrues
at
the
coupon
rate
and
is
compounded
at
a
stated
rate.
The
issuer
holds
the
accumulated,
compounded
interest
until
the
maturity
date
of
the
bonds.
At
the
maturity
date,
the
bondholder
receives
all
of
the
accumulated
interest
along
with
the
par
amount
of
the
security.
Reflecting
their
structure,
CABs
are
sometimes
called
compound
interest
bonds
or
accumulators.
Capital
expenditures
Expenditures
resulting
in
the
acquisition
of
or
addition

Capital
markets
disruptions
A
type
of
systemic
liquidity
risk.
The
risk
of
funding
problems
arising
from
problems
in
the
secondary
markets
for
financial
instruments.
For
a
community
bank,
the
main
problem
is
that
a
capital
market
disruption
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
bank
is
only
able
to
sell
investment
assets
at
very
unacceptable
prices.
See

Capital
markets
hedges
Hedging
done
with
instruments
traded
in
the
capital
markets,
including
but
not
limited
to
swaps,
options,
and
futures.
(These
hedge
instruments
are
derivatives.)
The
term
"capital
markets"
is
slightly
broader
than
"exchange
traded"
since
some
instruments,
such
as
interest
rate
swaps,
are
bought
and
sold
outside
of
the
exchanges
in
over
the
counter
(OTC)
markets
that
are
still
capital
markets.
Capitalization
(1)
The
process
of
imputing
a
value
to
an
income
stream
by
dividing
the
annual
net
income
before
income
taxes
and
depreciation
by
a
rate
of
return
expressed
as
a
decimal.
This
process
is
used
in
real
estate
lending
and
appraisals.
(2)
The
total
of,
or
the
mix
between,
a

lessee’s
balance
sheet.
Capitalization
ratio
A
measure
of
a
corporation’s
reliance
on
long-term
debt.
Similar
to
the
debt-to-worth
ratio
but
not
the
same.
This
ratio
is
calculated
by
dividing
long-term
debt
by
the
sum
of
long-term
debt
plus
equity.
Capitalized
interest
Interest
that
a
lender
"receives"
by
adding
the
unpaid
interest
to
the
amount
of
the
loan
balance
to
be
paid
by
the
borrower.
Capitalized
lease
Lease
obligations
that
must
be
capitalized
under
GAAP;
the
unpaid
future

terms
of
the
lease
must
be
shown
as
a
liability
on
the
firm's
balance
sheet.
As
a
general
rule,
this
requirement
applies
to
most

buildings
leased
by
a
business
and
used
in
the
conduct
of
the

as
short-term,
highly
liquid
investments
that
are
both:
(a)
readily
convertible
to
known
amounts
of
cash,
and
(b)
so
near
their
maturity
that
they
represent
insignificant
risk
of
changes
in

because
of
changes
in

rates.
Cash
flow
A
finance
and
accounting
term
used
to
describe
the
net
amount
of
cash
generated
by
a
firm’s
operations.
In
traditional
and
over-simplified
usage,
cash
flow
is
defined
as
the
sum
of
net
income
after
tax
plus
all
noncash
expenses
such
as
depreciation.
More
modern

defines
cash
flow
to
include
the
net
difference
between
all
cash
outflows

Cash
flow
hedge
A
type
of
hedge
defined
by
FAS
133.
An
entity
may
designate
a
derivative
instrument
as
hedging
the
exposure
to
variability
in
expected
future
cash
flows
that
is
attributable
to
a
particular
risk.
That
exposure
may
be
associated
with
a
recognized
asset
or
liability
such
as
all
or
some
of
the
future
interest
payments
due
for
a
variable-rate
debt.
Alternatively,
that
exposure
may
be
associated
with
a
forecasted
transaction
such
as
a
planned
purchase
or
sale.
Certain
requirements
must
be
met
to
qualify
for
cash
flow
hedge
accounting.
Gains
or
losses
from
the
effective
portion
of
a
derivative
used
for
a
qualifying
cash
flow
hedge
are
reported
in
comprehensive
income.
In
other
words,
the
gains
and
losses
are
used
to
adjust
equity
but
are
not
included
in
income
or
losses
from
operations.
Gains
or
losses
from
the

must
be
reflected
in
earnings.

is
used
almost
exclusively
by

who
were
trained
before
the
adoption
of

Chattel
paper
A
category
of
personal
property
defined
by
Article
9
of
the
UCC.
Chattel
paper
is
a
document
that
includes
both
a
monetary
obligation
and
a
security
interest
in
goods
or
a
lease.
For
example,
installment
sales
contracts
that
include
a
retail
purchaser's
promise
to
pay
and
a
security
interest
retained
by
the
seller
become
chattel
paper
for
a
bank
when
the
seller
pledges
them
to
another
party.
Such
a
document
is
often
called
dealer
paper
because
automobile
dealers
engaged
in
indirect
lending
frequently
sell
or
pledge
their
retail
installment
contracts
to
a
financial
institution.

Check
A
commercial

instrument
signed

21
Act
The
Check
Clearing
for
the
21st
Century
Act
(Pub.
L.
No.
108-100
-
signed
by
President
Bush
on
October
28,
2003).
The
law
facilitates
check
truncation
by
creating
a
new
negotiable
instrument
called
a
substitute
check,
which
permits
banks
to
truncate
original
checks,
to
process
check
information
electronically,
and
to
deliver
substitute
checks
to
banks
that
want
to
continue
receiving
paper
checks.
A
substitute
check
is
the
legal
equivalent
of
the
original
check
and
includes
all
the
information
contained
on
the
original
check.
The
law
does
not
require
banks
to
accept
checks
in
electronic
form
nor
does
it
require
banks
to
use
the
new
authority
granted
by
the
Act
to
create
substitute
checks.
Check
21
is
designed
to
foster
innovation
in
the
payments
system
and
to
enhance
its
efficiency
by
reducing
some
of
the
legal
impediments
to
check
truncation.
Check
truncation
A
process
whereby
deposited
checks
are
retained
by
the
fist
bank
(payee’s
bank)
with
notification
sent
to
the
local
bank
(payor’s
bank)
that
the
check
has
been
deposited.
Canceled
checks
are
not
returned
to
the
maker.
Sometimes
called
check
safekeeping.
Check-clearing
float
The
time
between
the
date
a

is
deposited
in
a

it
is

(n.)
(1)
An
informal
phrase
used
by
lenders
to
describe
a
provision
in
loan
documents,
usually
the
promissory
notes
used
for
lines
of
credit.
The
clean-up
provision
requires
that
the
loan
balance
outstanding
under
the
line
of
credit
be
reduced,
usually
to
zero,
for
a
period
of
time,
usually
one
or
two
months,
with
some
specified
frequency,
usually
annually.
Sometimes
called
an
"out
of
debt"
requirement.
A
clean-up
requirement
is
particularly
well
suited
to
borrowers
with
significant
seasonal
fluctuations
in
sales.

The
unwinding
of
an

carry
an
amount
of
insurance
equal
to
a
certain
specified
percentage
of
the
value
of
the
insured

Collateralized
bond
obligation
(CBO)
A
multi-tranche
security
secured
by
a
pool
of
corporate
securities
(generally
noninvestment-grade
corporate
bonds)
or
sovereign

Similar
to
the
more

that
in
a
CBO
the
tiers
or

are
created
with
differing
levels
of
credit

The
CBO
structure
creates
at
least
one
tier
of
investment-grade
bonds,

providing
liquidity
to
a

Collateralized
debt
obligation
(CDO)
(1)
A
multi-tranche
security
with
credit
risk
exposure
to
corporations.
A
securitization
of
corporate
obligations.
CDOs
can
be
securitizations
or
re-securitizations
of
commercial
loans,
corporate
bonds,
other
types
of
ABSs,
residential
MBSs,
commercial
MBSs,
and
emerging
market
debt.
CDOs
may
even
be
backed
by
other
CDOs.
Securitizations
of
corporate
bonds
are
a
type
of
CDO
called
a
collateralized
bond
obligation
or
CBO.
A
synthetic
CDO
uses
credit
default
swaps
rather
than
actual
corporate
obligations
to
create
a
pool
of
credit
exposure.
Similar
to
the
more
familiar
CMO,
except
that
in
a
CDO
the
tiers
or
tranches
are
created
with
differing
levels
of
credit
quality.
A
CBO
divides
the
credit
risk
of
a
pool
of
high
yield
bonds
into
different
classes
that
appeal
to
investors
with
different
credit
risk
tolerances.
The
CDO
structure
creates
at
least
one
tier
of
investment-grade
bonds.
The
contractual
rules
for
the
cash
flow
distributions
in
a
CDO
structure
enable
the
senior
tranches
to
receive
high
credit
ratings
by
shifting
risk
to
the
equity
tranche.
See
equity
tranche,
special

The
term
"CDO"
may

used
to
refer
to
the
special

that
holds
the
securitized

(CLO)
A
multi-tranche

Collateralized
mortgage
obligation
(CMO)
A
type
of
MBS
created
by
dividing
the
rights
to
receive
the
principal
and
interest
cash
flows
from
an
underlying
pool
of
mortgages
into
separate
classes
or
tiers.
The
tiers
or
classes
are
usually
called
tranches.
In
other
words,
it
is
a
multiclass
bond
backed
or
collateralized
by
mortgage
loans
or
mortgage
pass-through
securities.
A
given
tranche
is
typically
not
redeemed
until
all
bonds
with
earlier
priority
have
been
redeemed.

shorter
terms,
the
risk
resulting
from
the
potential
volatility
from
future
changes
in
prevailing
rates
is
shifted
away
from
the
shorter-term
tranche
or
tranches
and
onto
the
longer-term
tranches
and
the

customer.
If
the
bank’s
obligation
to

Commercial
loan
theory
of
liquidity
An
explanation
of
bank
liquidity
described
by
Adam
Smith:
short-term
loans
advanced
to
finance
salable
goods
on
the
way
from
producer
to
consumer
are
the
most
liquid
loans
the
bank
can
make.
These
are
self-liquidating
loans
because
the
goods
being
financed
will
soon
be
sold.
The
loan
finances
a
transaction
and
the
transaction
itself
provides
the
borrower
with
the
funds
to
repay
the
bank.
Adam
Smith
described
these
loans
as
liquid
because
their
purpose
and
their
collateral
were
liquid.
The
goods
move
quickly
from
the
producers
through
the
distributors
to
the
retail
outlet
and
then
are
purchased
by
the
ultimate
cash-paying
consumer.
Also
called
the
real
bills
doctrine.
Commercial
paper
Unsecured,
short-term
promissory
notes
issued
by

amounts
and
with
specific
maturity
dates.
Firms
with
lower
ratings
or
firms
without
well-known
names
usually
back
their
commercial
paper
with
guarantees
or
bank
letters
of
credit.
Commercial
paper
may
be
sold
on
a
discount
basis
or
may
be
interest
bearing.
Terms
can
be
as
short
as
1
day
and
usually
do
not
exceed
270
days.
Commercial
tort
claim

out
of
a
personal
injury
or

and
(b)
arises
out
of
the
normal
course
of
business

either
an
individual
or
organization.

Companion
tranche
A
specific
tier
or
segment
of
REMIC
security.
A
REMIC
tranche
that
is
structured
to
absorb
a
disproportionate
amount
of
the
volatility
caused
by
variations
in
the
prepayments
of
the
underlying
collateral.
Companion
tranches
are
created

the
name
companion.
Also
called
support
tranches.

are
used
to
determine
the
level
of
balances
to
be
left
with
the
bank.
Adjustments
are

interval
The
degree
of
certainty
that
an
event
will
fall
outside
of
boundaries

a
distribution.
For
a
normal
distribution,
boundaries
set
at
two
standard
deviations
from
the
mean
create
approximately
95
percent
confidence
intervals.
In
other
words,
only
5
percent
of
the
events
will
be
smaller
or
larger
than
the

conform
to
agency
requirements
regardless
of
whether
they
are
sold
or
retained
by
the
originator.
Even
though
a
conforming
mortgage
may
not
be
sold
to
FNMA
or
FHLMC,
its
amount,
repayment
terms,
and
documentation
meet
the
standards
of
those
agencies,
and
the
loan
may
be

Consideration
A
legal
term
used
to
describe
the
benefit
that
a
borrower,
guarantor,
or
pledgor
receives
in
exchange
for
agreeing
to
repay,
guarantee,
or
pledge
security
to
the
bank.
Usually,
but
not
always,
the
consideration
is
the
proceeds
of
the
loan.
In
some
states,
a
reasonable
expectation
of
benefit
can
be
sufficient.
Consideration
must
involve
benefit
that
is
meaningful,
which
means
that
the
value
of
the
consideration,
whether
or
not
it
is
directly
monetary,
must
be
comparable
to
the
benefit.

are
either
sold
or
returned
to
the
seller.
The

is
merely
a
consignee.
(2)
(verb)
—
The
physical
transfer
of
goods
from
a

to
the
goods
to
a
consignee
who
acts
as
a
selling
agent.
Note
that
not
all
consignments
are
"true"
consignments.
Also
note
that
not
all
true
consignments
are
covered
by
UCC
Article
9.
Consignee
Selling

net
worth,
income,
expense,
net

for
a

the
aggregate
of
the
values
for
each

item
for
all
of
the

Instead,
consolidated
statements
also
reflect
the
elimination
of
intercompany
transactions.
Consolidated
statements
disregard
the
distinction
between
separate
legal
entities
and
treat
a
parent
firm
and
its
subsidiaries
as
a
single
economic
entity.
Consolidating

the
same
remaining
time
until
maturity.
For
example,
the
one-year
CMT
is
the

yield
of
various
Treasury
securities
maturing
in

prepayment
(CPP)
An
expression
of
mortgage
loan
prepayments
in
annual
terms.
The
single
monthly
mortality
rate
(SMM)
multiplied
by

CPP
annualizes
SMM
without
reflecting
the
impact
of
compounding.
See
constant
prepayment
rate
and

Constant
prepayment
rate
(CPR)
A
measure
of
the
historical
or
expected
prepayment
of
principal

mortgage
or
an
MBS
that
expresses
the
prepayment
as
a
constant
proportion
of
the
outstanding
principal.
The
CPR
is
an
annualized
expression
of
the
SMM
that
reflects
compounding
and
is
therefore
more
accurate.

of
the
UCC.
It
is
a
lease
between
a
lessor
who
regularly
engages
in
the
business
of
leasing
or
selling
to
a
lessee
who
is
an
individual
and
who
takes
the
lease
for
personal,
family,
or
household
purposes.
To
meet
the
definition
of
a
consumer
lease,
the
total
payments
to
be
made
under
the
lease,
excluding
payments
for
options
to
renew
or
buy,
may
not
exceed
$25,000.
Any
prohibitions
on
a
party’s
right
to
transfer
its
rights
in
a
consumer
lease
must
be
in
writing,
conspicuous,
and
specific.
Consumer
Leasing
Act
A
federal
law
that
governs
consumer
leases.
The
act
is
implemented
by
Federal
Reserve
Regulation
M.
Compliance
with
the
Consumer
Leasing
Act
is
largely,
but
not
entirely,
a
matter
of
providing
the
consumer
with
required
disclosures
intended
to
enable
the
consumer
to
compare
different
leases.
Contagion
The
process
(verb)
or
risk
(noun)
were
a
crisis
in
one
bank,
country,
market
or
currency
spreads.
Typically,
regulators
worry
about
contagion
in
two
directions.
Upward
contagion
arises
when
idiosyncratic
problems
at
one
financial
institution
spread
to
create
systemic
problems.
Downward
contagion
arises
when
the
systemic
problems
lead
to
severe
problems
at
individual
banks
that
are
relatively
more
vulnerable.
Contingent
deferred
sales
charge
(CDSC)
See
back-end
load.
Contingent
liability
A
debt
or
obligation
that
becomes
a
liability
only
when
something
else
happens.
For
example,
a
guarantor
becomes
liable
for
his
guarantee
only
if
the
debt
that
is
guaranteed
does
not
get
paid
by
the
debtor.
Continuation
A
form
and
process
by
which
a
secured
party
extends
the
priority
of
its
security
interest
in
the
public
record.
The
priority
of
liens
created
under
Article
9
of
the
UCC
is
usually
established
by
filing
a
financing
statement.
Under
the
provisions
of
Article
9,
financing
statements
are
only
valid
for
five
years.
However,
a
financing
statement
can
be
renewed
by
filing
a
continuation
statement,
usually
a
UCC-3
form.
Continuations
must
be
filed
no
earlier
than
six
months
prior
to
the
expiration
of
the
financing
statement
and
no
later
than
the
expiration
date
of
the
financing
statement.
Continuations
last
for
five
years
and
can
be
extended
by
filing
another
continuation.
Continuing
guaranty
A
guaranty
in
which
the
guarantor
agrees
to
guarantee
all
future
loans
made
to
that
borrower
by
the
bank,
not
just
the
loan
or
loans
made
as
part
of
the
transaction
in
which
the
guaranty
was
obtained.
Continuous
repo
A
repo/reverse
repo
transaction
that
does
not
have
a
specified
term.
These
transactions
are
like
a
series
of
overnight
repos
renewed
daily.
The
repo
rate,
the
amount
of
funds
invested,
and/or
the
amount
of
collateral
is
adjusted
each
day.
Continuing
repos
are
commonly
used
in
conjunction
with
bank
sweep
accounts.
Under
a
continuing
repo
agreement,
the
transaction
is
terminated
whenever
either
party
requests
termination.
Also
called
open
repos.
Contra
account
Accounts
receivable
due
from
debtors
who
also
have
accounts
payable
due
to
them
from
the
borrower.
Contra
asset
An
asset
account
that
normally
has
a
credit
balance.
Examples
are
the
allowance
for
doubtful
accounts
and
accumulated
depreciation.
Contra
liability
A
liability
account
that
normally
has
a
debit
balance.
Contract
right
A
defined
term
under
the
1962
version
of
the
UCC
that
means
a
right
to
payment
under
a
contract
that
has
not
yet
been
earned
by
performance
and
is
not
evidenced
by
an
instrument
or
chattel
paper.
Under
the
1972
version
of
the
UCC,
these
rights
are
either
accounts
or
general
intangibles.
Contractual
gap
A
crude
measure
of
a
financial
institution’s
exposure
to
adverse
consequences
resulting
from
changes
in
prevailing
interest
rates.
The
contractual
gap
is
a
gap
mismatch
measure
calculated
using
the
contractual
maturity
and
repricing
dates
for
all
assets
and
liabilities.
It
is
arguably
the
least
accurate
gap
methodology.
Control
stock
Control
stock
is
stock
held
by
a
person
who
directly
or
indirectly
controls
the
management
of
the
issuing
company.
The
right
of
the
owner
or
a
pledgee
to
sell
control
stock
is
limited
by
provisions
in
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Acts.
Controlled
disbursement
bank
A
bank
that
can
provide
better
management
control
over
checks
being
presented.
Generally,
this
bank
is
located
outside
the
local
area
and
receives
only
presentments
from
the
Federal
Reserve
System
and
the
local
clearing-house.
Conventional
mortgage
A
mortgage
loan
based
solely
upon
the
value
of
the
mortgaged
real
estate
and
the
creditworthiness
of
the
borrower.
A
mortgage
loan
without
insurance
or
guarantees
from
a
government
agency.
Convergence
Describes
an
inevitable
change
in
the
relationship
between
cash
and
futures
prices
for
instruments
until
delivery.
Prior
to
delivery,
the
futures
price
and
the
cash
price
differ
by
the
cost
of
carry.
As
time
passes,
the
cost
of
carry
diminishes
and
the
futures
price
will
equal
the
cash
price
at
the
time
of
delivery.
This
is
a
necessary
condition
for
the
futures
contract
to
effectively
hedge
the
cash
instrument.
Conversion
premium
A
convertible’s
conversion
premium
is
the
amount
by
which
a
convertible’s
market
price
exceeds
its
value
in
stock.
The
premium
may
be
expressed
as
the
dollar
difference
or
as
a
percentage.
Conversion
ratio
The
specified
number
of
shares
of
common
stock
that
will
be
received
for
each
convertible
bond
or
share
of
convertible
preferred
stock
at
the
time
of
conversion.
This
ratio
is
specified
at
issuance
in
the
bond
indenture
agreement.
This
is
often
an
uneven
amount
using
partial
shares.
Conversion
value
For
convertibles,
the
value
in
stock.
Also
called
the
parity
value.
The
conversion
value
can
be
determined
by
multiplying
the
conversion
ratio
by
the
value
of
the
stock
at
any
point
in
time.
Convertible
ARM
An
ARM
for
which
the
borrower
has
the
option
to
convert
from
a
floating-rate
loan
to
a
fixed-rate
loan.
Convertible
ARMs
can
typically
be
converted
in
the
first
through
fifth
years
of
the
mortgage
loan.
Because
borrowers
can
exercise
their
conversion
option
for
a
modest
fee,
conversion
is
more
attractive
to
borrowers
than
the
alternative
of
obtaining
a
nonconvertible
ARM
and
then
later
refinancing
with
a
fixed-rate
loan
when
prevailing
rates
have
fallen.
Consequently,
prepayment
speeds
for
convertible
ARMs
are
faster
than
prepayment
speeds
for
nonconvertible
ARMs.
Convertible
bond
A
bond
that
includes
a
provision
allowing
the
holder
to
exchange
the
bond
for
a
quantity
of
the
issuer's
common
stock
at
some
fixed
exchange
ratio.
An
otherwise
normal
corporate
bond
that
has
a
fixed
maturity
date
that
pays
coupon
interest
and
repays
principal
at
maturity.
It
is
issued
with
an
option
to
exchange
the
bond
for
a
fixed
number
of
shares
of
common
stock
at
the
option
of
the
bondholder,
thereby
allowing
the
convertible
bond
to
share
in
the
growth
potential
of
the
underlying
common
stock.
It
is
senior
to
stock
within
the
corporate
equity
structure,
although
probably
junior
to
other
corporate
debt.
Convertible
bonds
are
often
callable.
Convertible
debt
spread
The
difference
between
the
coupon
interest
rate
on
the
convertible
and
the
coupon
interest
rate
on
the
issuing
company’s
nonconvertible
bonds.
The
amount
by
which
the
convertible’s
interest
is
lower
depends
on
a
number
of
factors,
including
the
structure
of
the
convertible
itself.
The
debt
spread
typically
ranges
from
two
to
five
percentage
points.
Convertible
preferred
stock
Preferred
stock
that
can
be
converted
into
the
common
stock
of
the
issuing
company.
Like
nonconvertible
preferred
stock,
the
convertible
preferred
stock
is
a
class
of
the
corporation’s
capital
stock;
has
a
specified
dividend
rate
that
is
usually
declared
quarterly
and
is
cumulative
(accumulates
in
arrears
if
the
corporation
does
not
make
the
payment);
and
has
priority
over
common
shares
for
dividend
payments.
Both
convertible
and
nonconvertible
preferred
stock
are
considered
to
be
perpetual,
but
in
fact,
both
are
callable.
Call
dates
on
convertible
preferreds
are
specified
in
the
prospectus
at
issuance.
Convexity
A
measure
of
the
sensitivity
of
duration
to
changes
in
yield
levels.
Convexity
is
a
measure
of
the
stability
or
instability
of
the
measured
duration
over
a
range
of
yields.
If
convexity
is
low,
that
is,
if
the
price/yield
relationship
is
close
to
a
straight
line,
duration
is
stable.
If
convexity
is
high,
duration
is
unstable.
The
greater
an
instrument’s
convexity,
the
less
accurate
duration
will
be.
See
duration,
effective
duration,
Macaulay
duration
and
modified
duration.
COP

Core
deposits
or

(1)
A
bank's
deposits
that
are
the
most
stable.
(2)
A
bank's
deposits
under
$100,000

Corporate
settlement
The
agreement
of
a
buyer
and
seller
to
exchange
the
security
and
the
payment
on
the
third
business
day
after
the
trade
date.

way
settlement
and
settlement.
Correlation
The
degree
of
relationship
between
two
sets
of
data.
A
correlation
near
plus
1,
called
a
positive
correlation,
indicates
that
changes
in
one
set
of
data
are
closely
related
to
changes
in
the
other
set
and
that
the
data
sets
change
in
the
same
direction.
A
correlation
near
minus
1,
called
negative
correlation,
indicates
that
changes
in
one
set
of
data
are
closely
related
to
changes
in
the
other
set
and
that
the
data
sets
change
in
the
opposite
direction.
A
correlation
near
zero
indicates
little
or
no
relationship
between
the
changes
in
the
two
sets
of
data.
Correlation
VAR
Correlation
VAR
is
a
measure
of
a
financial
instrument’s,
a
portfolio
of
financial
instruments,’
or
an
entity’s
exposure
to
reductions
in
value
resulting
from
changes
in
prevailing
interest
rates.
Also
called
analytical
VAR,
correlation
VAR
is
one
of
several
different
methods
for
calculating
VAR.
Analytical
or
correlation
VAR
compares
the
sensitivity
of
risk
elements
within
a
portfolio.
The
volatility
of
each
component
is
then
calculated
using
a
standard
matrix.
This
is
the
type
of
VAR
calculated
by
popular
models
such
as
RiskMetrics.
This
is
the
least
computationally
insensitive
of
the
three
statistically
based
VAR
measurements.
However,
this
approach
does
not
do
a
good
job
of
reflecting
option
risk
or
of
incorporating
the
risk
of
unlikely
events.

VAR,

COSO
(1)
The
Committee
of
Sponsoring
Organizations
of
the
Treadway
Commission.
Formed
in
1985
by
five
U.S.
professional
organizations
to
sponsor
the
National
Commission
on
Fraudulent
Financial
Reporting.
This
was
an
independent,
private
sector
initiative.
The
committee
developed
recommendations
used
by
financial
auditors,
the
SEC
and
regulators.

The
name
most
commonly
used
to
refer
to
guidelines
for
enterprise-wide
risk
management
(ERM)
called
"Internal
Control
-
Integrated
Framework".
These
COSO
guidelines
now
serve
two
purposes.
They
are
used
by
internal
and
external
auditors
to
implement
and
evaluate
a
firm's
financial
controls.
The
2002
Sarbanes-Oxley
Act
and
similar
legislation
is
a
primary
driver
of
this
application.
Financial
institutions
are
also
using
COSO
guidelines
for
ERM
in
general
but
primarily
for
the
identification
and
control
of
operations
risk.
The
Basel
II
capital
requirements
and
related
rules
issued
by
national
banking
regulators
are
a
primary
driver
of
this
application.

Cost
in
excess
of
billing
An
asset
created
under
a
type
of
accrual
accounting
used
when
firms
such
as
contractors
incur
expenses
in
accounting
periods
that
are
repaid
in
subsequent
accounting
periods.
This
account
is
comprised
of
money
spent
by
the
contractor
for
things
that
will
be
billed
to
buyer
at
a
future
date.
Cost
of
carry
The
cost
of
financing
an
asset.
If
the
cost
of
carry
is
smaller
than
the
interest
received
from
the
asset
by
the
investor,
the
investor
has
a
positive
carry.
Conversely,
if
the
cost
of
carry
is
larger
than
the
interest
received
from
the
asset
by
the
investor,
the
investor
has
a
negative
carry.
Cost-of-funds
index
(COFI)
The
weighted-average

institutions
to
obtain
funds.
There
are
national

sold
Amount
shown
on
a
firm's
income
statement
representing
the
direct
expenses
that
the
firm
incurred
for
sales.
Cost
of
goods
sold
is
always
a
debit
balance
and
is
shown
as
either
a

Counter
balancing
capacity
(CBC)
A
term
sometimes
used
to
describe
the
quantity
of
funds
that
a
financial
institution
can
obtain
to
meet
liquidity
requirements.
See
forward
cash
exposure.
Counterparty
A
term
used
to
identify
the
"other"
party
in
a
two-party
transaction.
For
example,
the
counterparty
of
a
buyer
is
the
seller
to
that
buyer.
The
term
counterparty
is
frequently
used
to
identify
the
other
party
in
repurchase
agreement
transactions
and
in
interest
rate
swap
transactions.
Counterparty
risk
The
risk
that
a
counterparty
will
default
(fail
to
perform)
on
its
obligation
under
a
contract.
Counterparty
risk
is
not
limited
to
credit
risk
(the
risk
that
the
counterparty
cannot
fulfill
its
contractual
obligations)
but
may
also
result
from
other
problems
associated
with
a
counterparty
unwilling
to
honor
the
contract.
Coupon
leverage
The
inclusion
of
a
multiple
in
the
formula
for
calculating
the
coupon
rate
on
an
inverse
floating-rate
CMO.
For
example,
an
inverse
floater
with
a
multiple
may
pay
interest
at
the
rate
of
22
percent
minus
the
product
of
2
times
the
1-month
London
Interbank
Offered
Rate
(LIBOR).
(Note
that
when
the
rate
formula
for
a
floater
or
inverse
floater
applies
a
multiple
to
a
sum,
the
CMO
tranche
is
called
a
super
floater.
See
super
floater.)
Coupon
yield

Coupon,
coupon
rate
(1)
The
rate
of
interest
received
by
the
holder
of
a
security.
Not
necessarily
the
same
as
the

realized
by
the

For
pass-through
securities,
the
holder’s
coupon
rate
is
the
gross
coupon
of
the
underlying
loans
less

Covariance
A
measurement
of
the
relationship
between
two
variables.
The
arithmetic
mean
of
the
products
of
the
deviations
of
corresponding
values
of
two
quantitative
variables
from
their
respective
means.
Covariant
The
condition
of
varying
with
something
else
in
a
way
that
satisfies
a
mathematical
relationship.
See
covariance.
Covenants
Restrictions
on
the
activities
of
a
debtor
written
into
bank
loan
agreements
or
bond
indenture
agreements.
Also
called
indenture
covenants
or
protective
covenants.
Contractual
terms
of
the
loan
or
indenture
agreement
that
prohibit
the
debtor
from
taking
actions
that
might
hurt
the
interests
of
the
lenders
or
bondholders.
Designed
to
protect
the
interests
of
creditors
—
often
(but
not
limited
to)
unsecured
creditors.
Four
common
examples
of
covenants
are
prohibitions
against:
issuing
new
debt,
paying
dividends
if
certain
minimum
financial
standards
are
not
maintained,
merging
with
another
company,
and
selling
corporate
assets.
Covered
calls
A
call
option
for
which
the
owner
of
a
security
grants
the
buyer
of
the
call
option
the
right
to
purchase
a
security
owned
by
the
option
seller.
The
opposite
of
naked
calls.
In
theory,
selling
covered
calls
can
be
a
hedging
strategy.
If
investment
prices
fall,
the
investor’s
loss
will
be
offset
by
the
income
from
the
covered
call.
(When
prices
fall,
the
call
option
is
likely
to
expire
unexercised
because
the
call
buyer
can
buy
the
security
on
the
open
market
at
a
lower
price.)
On
the
other
hand,
if
prices
rise,
the
seller's
gain
is
limited
to
the
difference
between
the
seller's
book
value
and
the
option
strike
price
(which
in
this
case
is
probably
less
than
the
market
price),
but
the
seller
also
retains
the
proceeds
of
the
option
sale.
For
banks,
regulatory
restrictions
as
well
as
practical
difficulties
may
restrict
the
suitability
of
covered
calls
as
hedging
tools.
Covered
put
The
sale
of
a
put
option
while
holding
sufficient
cash
to
buy
the
underlying.

Cram
down
An
informal
name
for
a
settlement
or
terms
that
a
debtor
forces
creditors
to
accept.
For
example,
a
debtor
in
Chapter
11
bankruptcy
proceedings
can,
subject
to
some
restrictions,
have
a
plan
to
resolve
the
bankruptcy
approved
by
the
court
even
though
a
creditor
or
a
class
of
creditors
objects.
Credit
default
swaps
See
credit
swap.
Credit
derivative
Contractual
arrangements
that
allow
one
party
to
transfer
credit
risk
of
a
reference
asset,
which
it
may
or
may
not
own,
to
one
or
more
counterparties.
The
first
party
may
be
called
the
"protection
buyer",
the
"beneficiary"
or
the
"originator".
The
counterparty
or
counterparties
may
be
called
the
"protection
seller"
or
the
"guarantor".
Credit
derivatives
are
contracts
for
transferring
risk
-
just
like
foreign
exchange,
commodity
and
interest
rate
risk
derivatives.
The
only
difference
is
the
type
of
risk
transferred.

return
swaps,
credit

Credit
enhancement
A
measure
that
alters
the
structure
of
a
security
in
a
way
that
reduces
its
credit
risk.
Credit
enhancement
may
take
the
form
of
a
letter
of
credit
issued
to
back
securities.
For
mortgage-backed
and
asset-backed
securities,
credit
enhancement
may
take
the
form
of
arrangements
to
over-collateralize
the
security.
Credit
event
A
term
used
in
credit
swap
and
some
other
credit
related
contracts.
The
specified
credit
event
in
each
contract
is
defined
by
the
parties
to
suit
their
particular
needs.
Typical
specified
credit
events
are
bankruptcy,
insolvency,
credit
rating
downgrade
or
failure
to
make
a
required
scheduled
payment.
Note
that
for
a
credit
swap
transaction,
these
events
do
not
refer
to
occurrences
or
change
impacting
one
of
the
contract
counter
parties.
Instead
they
refer
to
events
applicable
to
the
underlying
reference
asset.
The
defined
events
must
be
well-defined
and
unambiguous.
Credit
history
A
record
of
how
a
person
has
borrowed
and
repaid
debts.
Credit
linked
note
Credit
linked
security
A
type
of
credit
derivative
instrument.
Credit
linked
notes
are
a
securitized
form
of
credit
derivatives.
The
protection
buyer
issues
notes.
If
a
specified
credit
event
occurs,
the
investor
who
buys
the
notes
has
to
suffer
either
a
delay
in
repayment
or
has
to
forego
interest.
(The
specified
credit
event
is
pre-defined
can
be
any
one
of
a
number
of
alternatives.)
Also
known
as
credit
linked
security.
Credit
memos
Accounting
adjustments
that
reduce
account
receivable
balances
due
from
account
debtors.
Usually
credit
memos
are
generated
to
account
for
merchandise
that
is
returned
and
when
credit
is
given
to
customers
for
damaged
goods.
Credit
memos
are
the
accounting
reflection
of
charge-backs.
Credit
migration
Improvement
or
deterioration
in
an
obligor's
credit
worthiness
over
time.
Most
often
used
to
describe
the
improvement
or
deterioration
in
the
credit
worthiness
as
represented
by
a
rating
or
credit
grade.
Credit
options
A
type
of
credit
derivative
instrument.
Options
on
a
credit
spread
take
the
form
of
credit-spread
put
options.
The
put-buyer
pays
an
upfront
fee
to
the
put-seller
in
exchange
for
a
contingent
payment
in
the
event
that
the
credit
spread
for
an
asset
rises
beyond
a
pre-agreed
upon
threshold.
This
is
a
put
option
where
the
underlying
is
the
spread
on
a
third
party
security.
For
example,
if
you
were
holding
a
bond
issued
by
a
third
party
and
the
bond's
spread
over
the
comparable
Treasury
rate
were
200
basis
points,
you
might
purchase
an
option
that
pays
off
if
the
spread
widens
to
300
basis
points.
(Although
that
example
uses
the
Treasury
rate
as
a
basis
for
comparison,
it
is
becoming
more
common
to
use
swap
rates.)
In
other
words,
the
widening
of
the
credit
spread
to
a
defined
size
gives
the
protection
buyer
the
right
to
demand
a
payment
from
the
protection
seller.
Unlike
a
total
return
or
default
swap,
the
parties
in
a
credit
spread
option
do
not
have
to
agree
upon
any
specific
credit
events.
The
fact
that
the
market
spread
for
the
underlying
rises
compared
to
the
reference
index
rate
is,
in
effect,
a
proxy
for
a
deterioration
in
the
credit
quality.
Also
known
as
credit
spread
options
and
credit
spread
put
options.
Credit
risk
The
risk
to
earnings
or
capital
from
the
potential
that
a
borrower
or
counterparty
will
fail
to
perform
on
an
obligation.
Usually,
but
not
always,
the
obligation
in
question
is
a
requirement
to
make
interest
or
principal
payments.
Sometimes
called
default
risk,
the
failure
to
make
required
payments
reduces
the
value
of
equity
securities,
debt
securities,
and
loans.
In
the
extreme,
credit
defaults
eliminate
all
or
almost
all
of
the
value
in
loans
or
securities.
Adverse
consequences
from
credit
risk
are
not
restricted
to
default,
the
ultimate
manifestation
of
credit
risk.
In
addition,
asset
owners
can
suffer
from
reductions
in
value
resulting
from
either
real
or
perceived
declines
in
the
obligor’s
financial
strength.
Both
the
Office
of
the
Comptroller
of
the
Currency
(OCC)
and
the
Federal
Reserve
list
credit
risk
as
one
of
their
defined
risk
types
for
risk-based
examinations.
Credit
risk
exposure
is
found
in
all
activities
in
which
success
depends
on
the
performance
of
a
counterparty,
issuer,
or
borrower.
Credit
risk
arises
any
time
a
financial
institution
extends,
commits,
invests,
or
otherwise
exposes
its
funds
through
actual
or
implied
contractual
agreements,
whether
reflected
on
or
off
the
balance
sheet.
Credit
scoring
system
A
statistical
system
used
to
determine
whether
or
not
to
grant
credit
by
assigning
numerical
scores
to
various
characteristics
related
to
creditworthiness.

Credit
swap
A
type
of
credit
derivative
instrument.
Swap
contracts
in
which
one
party
makes
payments
only
if
a
specified
credit
event
occurs.
In
a
credit
default
swap,
the
protection
seller
agrees,
for
an
upfront
or
periodic
fee,
to
compensate
the
protection
buyer
upon
the
happening
of
the
specified
credit
event.
Credit
default
swaps
are
similar
to
a
traditional
financial
guarantees
but
more
flexible.
It
is
more
flexible
because
a
credit
swap
need
not
be
limited
to
compensation
upon
an
actual
default.
The
specified
credit
event
in
each
swap
is
defined
by
the
parties
to
suit
their
particular
needs.
Variations
of
the
basic
structure
outlined
in
this
definition
are
also
used.
Also
known
as
default
swaps
or
credit
default
swaps.
See
credit
derivative,
credit
event
and
reference
asset.
Credit
watch
A
warning
issued
by
a
credit
rating
agency
alerting

and
may
be
upgraded
or

Creditor
A
party
who
is
owed
money
by
another
party.
Creditworthiness
A
creditor's

Critical
path
A
sequence
of
those
tasks
(e.g.,
in
payment
processing)
which
must
be
completed
before
the
next
task
can
be
started.
Anything
not
on
the
critical
path
is
something
that
can
be
done
later
without
delaying
an
important
step.
Cross
collateralization
Extension
of
the
creditor's
interest
in
property
of
the
debtor
so
that
collateral
for
one
debt
also
serves
as
collateral
for
one
or
more
other
debts.
Cross
correlation
Statistical
term
for
the
degree
of
similiarity
for
two
different
sets
of
data.
Cross
default
Provision
in
the
loan
documents
in
which
the
debtor
agrees
that
default
on
one
loan
will
also
constitute
default
on
other
obligations
to
the
creditor.
Cross
hedge
A
hedge
transaction
in
which
a
cash
market
instrument
is
hedged
by
an
option
contract
for
a
different
underlying
instrument.
Sometimes
called
proxy
hedge,
surrogate
hedge,
or
tandem
hedge.
Cross
stream
guaranty
A
phrase
sometimes
used
to
describe
a
guaranty
of
a
loan
to
a
borrowing
entity
when
the
borrowing
entity
is
affiliated
with
the
guarantor
corporation
through
common
ownership
but
is
neither
a
parent
nor
a
subsidiary
corporation.
For
the
purposes
of
this
definition,
the
borrower
and
the
guarantor
do
not
necessarily
have
to
meet
the
accounting
definition
of
affiliates.

considered
the
most
liquid.
Usually
comprised
of
cash,
accounts
receivable,
inventory,
and
a
few
minor
items.
The
subgrouping
of
assets
into

current
factor.
Analogous
to
the

Current
liabilities
The
group
of
liabilities
considered
to
be
the
shortest
term.
Usually
comprises
accounts
payable,

other
short-term
accounts
or
notes
payable,
current
portion
of
long-term
debt,
and
a
few
minor
items.
The
subgrouping
of
liabilities
into
current
and
long-term
categories
is
common
for
all
financial
statements
except
for
firms
in
the
financial
industry.
Current
ratio
The
ratio
obtained
when
total
current
assets
are
divided
by
total
current
liabilities.
A
commonly
used
but
not
always
good
proxy
for
a
firm's
liquidity.
Current
yield
(1)
For
bonds,
a
measure
of
the
simple
interest
annual
yield
for
investments
with
coupon
rates
and
with
maturities
of
one
year
or
more.
To
calculate
the
current
yield,
the
annual
coupon
interest
income
is
simply
divided
by
the
amount
paid
to
acquire
the
investment.
It
is
important
to
note
that
the
current
yield
is
only
accurate
for
investments
purchased
at
par.
The
current
yield
calculation
includes
just
one
income
cash
flow
-
the
annual
coupon
interest
income.
It
ignores
the
profit
or
loss
resulting
from
discounts
and
premiums.
(2)
For
stocks,
the
annual
dividend
income
divided
by
the
price
per
share.
Cushion
bonds
An
informal
name
for
callable
bonds
with
long
maturities
that
have
coupon
rates
well
above
current
market
rates.
Because
these
bonds
have
such
high
coupon
rates,
they
trade
at
prices
and
yields
calculated
to
the
call
date
rather
than
to
the
maturity
date.
This
makes
the
cushion
bond’s
price
less
volatile.
If
prevailing
rates
remain
the
same,
fall,
or
rise
to
any
level
not
greater
than
the
coupon
rate,
the
bond
will
offer
a
competitive
return.
Even
if
rates
do
rise
to
exceed
the
coupon
rate,
the
cushion
bond
offers
a
higher
yield
in
exchange
for
its
longer
maturity
since
the
premium
paid
at
purchase
can
be
amortized
over
a
longer
period.
CUSIP
number
A
nine-digit
letter
and
number

traded
securities.
Each
publicly
traded

receives
a
unique
CUSIP
number
when
the

is
issued.
Custodial
agreement
A
written
contract
establishing
the
responsibilities
of
a
custodian
who
holds
property.
In
finance,
the
custodian
holds
collateral
for
deposits
with
financial
institutions,
investment
securities,
or
securities
underlying
repurchase
agreements.
Custodial
credit
risk
The
risk
that
a
financial
instrument
owner
will
suffer
a
loss
resulting
from
the
default
of
a
third
party
that
holds
the
financial
instrument.
The
third
party
might
be
a
safekeeping
agent
or
a
secured
creditor.
The
financial
instruments
are
typically
deposits
or
securities.
Customer
identification
program
(CIP)
A
proposed
requirement
under
the
Bank
Secrecy
Act
that
all
financial
institutions
implement
a
written,
risk-based
customer
identification
program,
maintain
information
used
to
verify
identities
and
compare
the
names
of
new
customers
against
government
lists
of
known
or
suspected
terrorists
or
terrorist
organizations.
The
proposed
rule
would
apply
to
all
customers
seeking
to
open
new
accounts.
Cyclical
liquidity
risk
A
type
of
systemic
liquidity
risk.

individual
who
buys
and
sells
for
his

for
an
instant,
between
a
purchase
from
one
party
and
a
sale
to

is
thus
compensated
by
the
spread
between
the
price
paid

Decay
analysis
Statistical
analysis
of
the
rate
of
attrition.
Decay
analysis
is
used
to
analyze
historical
volatility
of
core
deposit
volumes,
specifically
rates
for
withdrawals
and
account
closures.
Deposit
decay
rates
should
be
calculated
by
tracking
a
representative
sample
of
accounts
over
a
period
of
time
that
covers
at
least
one
interest
rate
cycle.
Such
volatility
studies
have
been
used
by
banks
for
many
years
to
determine
effective
maturity
assumptions
that
are
then
employed
in
present
value
analysis
to
calculate
core
deposit
values
for
deposit
purchases,
branch
acquisitions,
and
bank
acquisitions.

in
favor
of
the
lender
and
then
reconveys
the
title
to
the
borrower
when
the
loan
is
paid
in

put
option)
the
strike
price
of
the

interest
or
a
premium
specified
in
a
loan
document
to
be
added
to
the
contractual
rate
of
interest
that
can
be
charged
by
the
lender
if
the
borrower
is
in
default.
Default
risk
The
risk
arising
from
the
chance
that
debtors
will
not
make
promised
payments
either
on
time
or
in
full.
Also
called
credit
risk.
Defeasance
The
legal
release
of
a
debtor
from
being
the
primary
obligor
under
the
debt,
either
by
the
courts
or
by
the
creditor.
Also
called
legal
defeasance.
See
in-substance
defeasance.
Deferred
charges
Costs
capitalized
as
assets
on
a
firm's
balance
sheet
for
expenses
such
as
long-term
expenses
that
will
not
be
recovered
in
the
normal
working
capital
cycle
of
the
business
or
expenditures
that
will
be
charged
to
future
operations.
Examples
include
costs
of
rearranging

Deferred
tax
asset
An
asset
reflecting
a
likely
reduction
in
future
income
taxes.
Accounting
for
deferred
tax
assets
is
governed
by
FAS
109.
Deferred
taxes
A
liability
account
that
reflects
the
accumulated
difference
between
the
amount
of
income
tax
that
the
firm
shows
each
year
as
an
expense
on
its
financial
statements
and
the
amount
of
income
tax,
usually
lower,
that
the
firm
pays
to
the
government.
Defined
benefit
plan
A
pension
or
other
employee
benefit
plan
that
provides
specified
amounts
of
benefits
to
eligible
participants.
The
specified
amounts
of
benefits
are
usually
determined
based
upon
age,
years
of
service,
and/or
levels
of
compensation.
Defined
contribution
plan
A
pension
or
other
employee
benefit
plan
that
provides
a
specified
contribution
amount
for
the
benefit
of
eligible
employees.
The
participants
ultimately
receive
amounts
that
depend
on
both
the
accumulated
contributions
and
the
investment
returns
realized
from
investment
of
the
accumulated
contributions.
Delay
days
Lag
times.
The
amount
of
time
before
the
owner
of
a
MBS
receives
payments
from
the
underlying
mortgages.
The
time
between
when
the
underlying
mortgagors
make
their
payments
to
the
servicers
and
when
those
payments
are
due
to
the
MBS
investors.
Delay
days
may
refer
to
either
stated
delay
or
actual
delay
days.
Stated
delay
days
is
the
number
of
days
from
the
issuance
of
an
MBS
pool
or
from
the
beginning
of
the
interest
accrual
period
until
the
first
payment
remitted
to
the
investors
who
own
the
right
to
receive
the
cash
flow.
For
example,
a
GNMA
MBS
pool
with
a
stated
delay
of
45
days
would
pay
interest
accrued
in
January
to
security
holders
on
February
15.
Actual
delay
days
is
the
monthly
lag,
measured
in
days,
between
the
date
the
payments
are
due
from
a
mortgage
loan
borrower
and
the
date
that
the
pro
rata
share
of
those
payments
is
remitted
to
the
MBS
investors
who
own
the
right
to
receive
the
cash
flow.
Thus,
since
the
January
payment
is
not
due
until
February
1,
GNMA
holders
who
receive
January’s
payment
on
February
15
have
14
actual
delay
days.
De-leveraged
bonds
Bonds
that
pay
interest
to
investors
according
to
a
formula
based
on
a
fraction
of
the
increase
or
decrease
in
a
specified
index.
De-leveraged
bonds
are
a
type
of
structured
note.
Delivery
and
acceptance
certificate
A
document
that
evidences
the
fact
that
goods
have
been
delivered
to
a
purchaser
or
lessee
and
accepted
by
that
purchaser
or
lessee.
Delivery
float
The
time
between
when
a
check
is
ready
for
disbursement
and
when
the
vendor
or
employee
actually
receives
it.
For
vendors,
this
may
be
considered
the
same
as
mail
float.
Delivery
vs.
payment
(DVP)
The
simultaneous
exchange
of
securities
and
cash.
The
safest
method
of
settling
either
the
purchase
or
sale
of
a
security.
In
a
DVP
settlement,
the
funds
are
wired
from
the
buyer's
account
and
the
security
is
delivered
from
the
seller's
account
in
simultaneous,
interdependent
wires.
Delta
(1)
The
Greek
letter
used
by
mathematicians
to
refer
to
change
or
the
quantity
of
change.
(2)
The
price
sensitivity
of
an
option.
The
change
in
an
option’s
price
divided
by
the
change
in
the
price
of
the
underlying
instrument.
As
an
option
becomes
deeper
in
the
money,
its
delta
gets
closer
to
1.0.
As
an
option
get
further
out
of
the
money,
its
delta
gets
closer
to
zero.
However,
the
change
is
nonlinear
-
the
delta
changes
faster
when
the
option
is
close
to
being
in
the
money.
The
rate
of
change
in
an
option’s
delta
is
called
the
option’s
gamma.
Demand
Term
used
to
describe
a
creditor's
right
to
request
payment
in
full
of
a
debt.
Demand
deposit
A
deposit
account
that
permits
the
depositor
to
withdraw
funds
on
demand.
Usually,
but
not
always,
a
checking
account.
Sometimes
called
demand
deposit
account
(DDA).
Demand
note
A
promissory
note
that
calls
for
principal
to
be
payable
on
demand.
In
recent
years,
courts
have
significantly
restricted
the
circumstances
under
which
a
bank
could
make
and
enforce
a
demand
for
repayment
under
a
demand
note.
Dematerialized
A
term
used
to
describe
a
physical
certificate
representing
ownership
of
a
security
(a
stock
certificate
or
a
bond)
that
is
held
by
a
trustee.
This
is
an
arrangement
through
which
a
physical
certificate
is
held
so
that
all
future
transactions
can
be
conducted
as
if
the
security
were
issued
as
a
book-entry
security.
Ownership
and
liens
are
recorded
in
the
records
of
the
trustee
rather
than
evidenced
by
physical
possession
of
the
certificate.
Also
called
immobilized.
Less
often,
dematerialized
is
used
to
refer
to
book-entry
securities
that
have
never
been
issued
in
physical
form.
Denomination
The
par
value
of
a
bond.
Department
of
Housing
and
Urban
Development
(HUD)
A
department
of
the
U.S.
government
that
promotes
private
and
public
housing.
FHA
and
GNMA
are
agencies
within
HUD.
Departure
provision
A
specific
provision
in
the
USPAP
rules
for
real
estate
appraisals.
The
departure
provision
states
that:
"An
appraiser
may
enter
into
an
agreement
to
perform
an
assignment
that
calls
for
something
less
than,
or
different
from,
the
work
that
would
otherwise
be
required
by
the
specific
guidelines."
An
appraisal
conducted
under
the
departure
provision
is
called
a
limited
appraisal.
See
complete
appraisal,
limited
appraisal,
and
Uniform
Standards
of
Professional
Appraisal
Practice.
Deposit
notes
A
form
of
bank
obligation
that
is
similar
to
a
deposit.
Deposit
notes
are
typically
issued
with
terms
from
two
to
five
years.
Like
CDs,
deposit
notes
are
issued
for
specified
terms
at
either
specified
rates
or
specified
rate
formulas.
Unlike
CDs,
deposit
notes
are
sold
in
a
predetermined
amount
for
a
predetermined
time
period.
The
deposit
note
terms
are
usually
described
in
an
offering
circular
similar
to
an
offering
of
securities.
For
investors,
the
primary
difference
between
bank
CDs
and
bank
deposit
notes
is
the
way
in
which
interest
is
calculated.
Like
many
government
agency
securities
and
corporate
bonds,
interest
rates
for
deposit
notes
are
typically
calculated
using
accrual
methods
that
assume
a
360-day
year
comprised
of
months
that
all
have
30
days.
Deposit
notes
may
be
rated
by
a
nationally
recognized
statistical
rating
organization
(NRSRO).
Depository
bank
A
bank
used
as
the
point
of
deposit
for
cash
receipts
Depository
Trust
Company
(DTC)
An
organization
that
holds
physical
certificates
for
stocks
and
bonds
and
issues
receipts
to
owners.
Securities
held
by
DTC
are
immobilized
so
that
they
can
be
traded
on
a
book-entry
basis.
Depreciation
The
amount
by
which
a
fixed
asset's
accounting
or
book
value
is
periodically
reduced
to
reflect
the
fact
that
the
economic
value
of
the
asset
is
steadily
reduced
by
a
combination
of
wear
and
tear
from
use,
age,
and/or
obsolescence.
The
offsetting
entry
is
depreciation
expense.
Derivatives
(1)
Financial
instruments
whose
value
depends
upon
the
values
of
underlying
assets,
interest
rates,
currency
exchange
rates,
or
indexes.
Various
authorities
define
derivative
instruments
in
broad,
inclusive
terms
or
narrow,
exclusive
terms.
It
is
a
common
misconception
that
all
derivatives
are
high-risk,
speculative
instruments.
Large
financial
institutions
use
derivatives
for
hedging.
Options,
futures,
swaps,
and
swaptions
are
common
derivatives
used
for
hedging
purposes.
All
CMOs
are
derivatives.
There
are
many
derivative
instruments,
and
new
ones
are
developed
often.
See
underlying.
(2)
In
FAS
133,
FASB
defines
derivatives
narrowly.
With
some
exceptions,
FAS
133
defines
a
derivative
instrument
to
be
any
financial
instrument
or
other
contract
that
has
all
three
of
the
following
characteristics:
A.
The
financial
instrument
or
contract
has
both:
1.
One
or
more
underlyings.
2.
One
or
more
notional
amounts
or
payment
provisions
or
both.
B.
The
financial
instrument
or
contract
either
does
not
require
an
initial
investment
or
requires
an
initial
net
investment
that
is
"smaller
than
the
amount
that
would
be
required
for
other
types
of
contracts
that
would
be
expected
to
have
a
similar
response
to
changes
in
market
factors."
C.
The
terms
of
the
financial
instrument
or
contract
either
1.
Require
or
permit
net
settlement.
2.Provide
that
the
contract
can
be
readily
settled
net
by
a
means
outside
the
contract.
3.Provide
for
delivery
or
an
asset
that
puts
the
recipient
in
a
position
not
substantially
different
from
net
settlement.
Mainly
as
a
result
of
FASB’s
second
requirement,
financial
instruments
such
as
CMOs
and
structured
notes
that
are
commonly
called
derivatives
are
not
derivatives
as
defined
by
FASB.

Dilution
(1)
The
difference
between
gross
sales
and
net
sales.
Dilution
is
caused
by
sales
that
are
reversed
as
a
result
of
returns
and/or
allowances.
(2)
The
reduction
in
an
existing
stockholder’s
position
that
results
from
the
issuance
of
new
shares.
Dilution
rate
Dilution
as
a
percentage
of
gross
sales.
Dime
An
informal
name
for

basis
points.
Direct
deposit
A
system
wherein
amounts
are
transferred
from
a
payor’s
checking
account
to
the
accounts
of
payees
no
matter
where
they
bank.
The
transfers
are
made
electronically
and
do
not
require
a
paper
check
or
draft.
The
key
consideration
is
that
the
transaction
is
accomplished
without
involving
the
payee.
Direct
hedges
A
form
of
capital
markets
or
derivatives
hedge
in
which
the
cash
market
instrument
being
hedged
is
hedged
by
an
options
or
futures
contract
on
the
same
underlying
instrument.
For
example,
a
91-day
U.S.
Treasury
bill
hedged
with
a
Treasury
bill
future.
Because
traded
futures
and
options
contracts
have
underlying
instruments
tied
to
securities,
retail
banks
do
not
have
much
opportunity
to
use
direct
hedges
to
manage
the
interest
rate
risk
in
their
loans
and
deposit
portfolios.
The
opposite
of
a
direct
hedge
is
a
cross
hedge.
Direct
lease
A
form
of
lease
financing
in
which
the
bank
acquires
property
from
a
supplier
and
then
leases
that
property
directly
to
an
end
user.
The
bank
is
the
owner
and
the
lessor
and
the
end
user
is
the
lessee.
Direct
verification
The
audit
procedure
of
mailing
the
account
debtor
a
note
requesting
the
account
debtor
to
confirm
the
balance
owed.
Directionally
correct
An
expression
used
to
indicate
that
a
measurement
is
accurate
to
the
extent
that
it
shows
the
quantity
to
be
measured
to
be
positive
or
negative
even
though
the
degree
to
which
the
quantity
is
positive
or
negative
may
be
measured
inaccurately.
Disbursement
float
The
total
time
period
between
when
a
check
is
prepared
by
the
remitter
and
when
the
check
is
presented
for
payment.
This
float
also
includes
the
delivery
float,
processing
float,
and
transit
float.
Disbursement
float
is
the

period
for
the
remitter.
The
collection
float
for
the
organization
that
will
receive
the

Discharge
(1)
The
action
of
releasing
a
lien
or
the
document
in
which
the
creditor
relinquishes
a
lien.
Also
known
as
a
satisfaction,
a
release,
a
reconveyance,
or
an
extinguishment.
However,
release
tends
to
be
used
in
connection
with
both
real
and
personal
property,
while
the
discharge,
extinguishment,
reconveyance,
and
satisfaction
are
more
often
used
only
in

in
which
the
CPA
states
that
he
or
she
cannot
express
an
opinion
because
of
limitations
in
either
the
scope
of
the

and/or
because
of
uncertainties
about
the

Discount
The
amount
by
which
the
price
for
a
security
is
less
than
its
par
or
face
value.
The
discount
or
difference
between
such
a
reduced
value
purchase
price
and
the
redemption
(par)
value
comprises
all
or
part
of
the
investor's
compensation
for
owning
the
security.
Discount
rate
(1)
The
percentage
rate
applied
to
the
redemption
value
of
a
security
in
order
to
calculate
a
reduced
value
for
a
purchaser.
Some
(or
all
in
the
case
of
zero
coupon
securities)
of
the
investor’s
return
comes
from
the
resulting
price
discount.
(2)
The
rate
of
return
for
short-term
securities
for
which
the
investor’s
entire
compensation
comes
from
the
discount
amount.
(3)
The
rate
of
interest
charged
by
the
Federal
Reserve
Banks
for
advances.
(4)
An
interest
rate
applied
to
a
single
cash
flow
that
will
not
be
paid
or
received
until
a
future
time
in
order
to
calculate
the
present
value
of
that
future
cash
flow.
(5)
An
interest
rate
or
a
series
of
interest
rates
applied
to
every
one
of
the
future
cash
flows
of
interest
and
principal
expected
from
a
financial
instrument
in
order
to
create
a
single
value
for
that
instrument.
This
single
value
is
equivalent
to
the
sum
of
the
present
values
for
each
of
the
separate
cash
flows
expected
from
the
instrument.
When
prevailing
market
rates
are
used
as
the
discount
rate,
this
technique
produces
a
fair
market
value
that
is
used
as
a
proxy
for
market
value
when
the
market
value
of
a
financial
instrument
is
not
readily
available.

value.
Discount
securities
(1)
Securities
that
do
not
pay
periodic

earn
the
difference
between
the
discount
issue
price
and
the
full
face
value
paid
at
maturity.
Treasury
bills,
banker’s
acceptances,
and
zero

Discounted
cash
flow
A
technique
or
process
for
valuing
a
financial
instrument
by
applying
a
discount
rate
(or
a
series
of
discount
rates)
to
calculate
a
present
value
of
each
future
interest
and
principal
cash
flow
expected
from
a
financial
instrument.
The
sum
of
the
market
values
of
the
cash
flows
is
considered
to
be
the
value
of
the
instrument.
For
financial
instruments
with
readily
available,
current
trade
prices,
this
value
is
called
the
fair
value
and
is
used
in
lieu
of
a
trade-
or
transaction-based
market
value.
Disintermediation
(1)
The
investing
of
funds
that
would
normally
have
been
placed
in
a
bank
or
other
financial
institution
(financial
intermediaries)
directly
into
investment
instruments
issued
by
the
ultimate
users
of
the
funds.
Investors
and
borrowers
transact
business
directly
and
thereby
bypass
banks
or
other
financial
intermediaries.

the
ultimate
users
of
capital.

Dividend
received
deduction
(DRD)
Federal
tax
law
allows
a
C
corporation
investing
in
the
stock
of
other
corporations
to
take
a
tax
deduction
for
the
dividend
income
received
from
other
corporations.
This
tax
treatment
applies
to
dividends
from
preferred
and
convertible
preferred
stock
in
addition
to
common
stock.
The
deduction
is
usually,
but
not
always,
70
percent
of
the
dividend
amount
received.
Dividends
(1)
Part
of
a

DK
Acronym
for
"Don’t
Know."
A
security
is
said
to
be
"DK'd"
when
it
is
delivered
to
the
purchaser
or
more
typically
the
purchaser's
correspondent
but
is
rejected
because
the
purchaser
either
doesn't
know
or
doesn't
agree
with
one
or
more
of
the
aspects
of
the
trade.
For
example,
a
trade
may
be
DK'd
because
of
an
incorrect
price,
amount,
or
CUSIP
number.

Dollar
roll
A
short-term
funding
technique
used
for
mortgage
pass-through
securities.
A
seller
of
a
roll
agrees
to
sell
a
mortgage
security
at
an
agreed-upon
price
on
a
specified
date
and
to
buy
back
a
similar
security
at
a
specified
future
date.
The
seller
receives
the
use
of
the
funds
for
the
specified
time
period
but
does
not
receive
the
monthly
cash
flows
from
the
mortgage
security
during
the
roll
period.
The
buyer
or
counterparty
agrees
to
buy
the
mortgage
security
at
an
agreed-upon
price
and
to
sell
back
a
similar
security
at
a
specified
future
date.
The
buyer
is
the
owner
of
the
security
for
that
time
period
and
as
the
owner
is
entitled
to
all
of
the
cash
flows
during
that
period.
Unlike
a
repo/reverse
repo
transaction,
at
the
end
of
the
transaction
time
period,
the
buyer
is
only
required
to
resell
a
substantially
similar
security
to
the
seller.

Due-on-sale
clause
A
provision

when
the
property
is

Duration
A
sophisticated
measure
of
the
average
timing
of
cash
flows
from
an
asset
or
a
liability
or
from
an
asset
portfolio
or
a
liability
portfolio.
Essentially,
duration
is
a
more
accurate
measure
of
maturity
because
it
reflects
the
timing
of
cash
flows
from
periodic
interest
and/or
principal
payments
in
addition
to
the
cash
flows
represented
by
the
funds
transferred
at
maturity.
Duration
is
computed
by
summing
the
present
values
of
all
of
the
future
cash
flows
after
multiplying
each
by
the
time
until
receipt,
and
then
dividing
that
product
by
the
sum
of
the
present
value
of
the
future
cash
flows
without
weighting
them
for
the
time
of
receipt.
One
way
to
view
duration
is
as
the
balancing
point
for
a
series
of
cash
flows.
One
author
described
it
as
that
"sweet
spot"
or
"balancing
point"
somewhere
between
the
day
a
position
is
acquired
and
the
day
that
it
matures,
where
the
return
remains
practically
unchanged
no
matter
what
happens
to
interest
rates.

Duration
drift
A
phrase
used
to
describe
the
slow
but
inexorable
change
in
duration
that
occurs
with
the
passage
of
time.
Measurements
of
duration
must
be
regularly
recalculated
because
of

MVPE
The
measured
interest
rate
sensitivity
of
bank
equity
calculated
with
the
use
of

methodology.
The
modified

This
name
is
used
to
distinguish
between
MVPE

the
more

Duration
of
equity
An
application
of
duration
analysis
that
measures
the
interest
rate
sensitivity
of
the
bank
as
whole.
Duration
of
equity
views
the
bank's
equity
as
if
it
were
a
bond.
This
"bond"
has
a
stream
of
obligations
for
future
cash
inflows.
Those
are
the
cash
flows
from
the
bank's
assets.
It
also
has
a
stream
of
obligations
for
future
cash
outflows.
Those
are
the
cash
flows
from
the
bank's
liabilities.
When
the
present
value
weighted
average
for
the
asset
cash
flows
is
calculated
and
reduced
by
the
total
of
the
present
value
weighted
cash
flows
from
the
liabilities,
then
the
duration
of
the
equity
"bond"
is
determined.
It
is
expressed
by
the
formula:
duration
of
equity
=
duration
of
assets
minus
(the
duration
of
liabilities
times
(total
liabilities
divided
by
total
assets)).

Early
amortization
event
A
type
of
credit
enhancement
used
in
asset
backed
securities.
One
or
more
triggers,
defined
in
the
asset
backed
security's
documentation
require
the
termination
of
revolving
periods,
controlled
amortization
periods
and/or
accumulation
periods.
Once
triggered,
the
early
amortization
provision
requires
that
the
monthly
principal
payments
be
distributed
to
investors
as
they
are
received.

Earnings
credit
rate
An
interest
rate
applied
to
investable
account
balances
to
determine
how
much
expense
for
bank
services
used
by
a
depositor
is
offset
by
the
deposits
maintained
by
that
depositor.
The
same
calculation
can
work
in
the
opposite
way
by
applying
the
earnings
credit
rate
to
the
actual
service
charges
to
determine
how
much
deposit
balance
is
needed
to
pay
for
the
charges.
The
earnings
credit
rate
is
always
expressed
as
an
annual
rate
even
though
the
calculations
are
usually
done
monthly.
Also
called
earnings

Econometric
models
Systems
of
mathematical
formulas
that
attempt
to
represent
the
interaction
of
various
macroeconomics
variables.
Some
economists
use
these
models
to
predict
the
alterations
that
will
result
from
changes
in
one
or
more
economic
conditions.
These
models

Economic
Development
Corporation
(EDC)
A
special
type
of
corporation
established
by
a
community
solely
to
act
as
a
conduit.
The
EDC
can,
as
a
municipal
entity,
borrow
funds
or
sell
securities
that
are,
in
most
cases,
exempt
from
federal
income
tax.
Consequently,
the
EDC
can
raise
funds
at
lower
interest
rates
than
businesses.
The
lower-cost
funds
are
used
by
the
EDC
to
buy
fixed
assets
that
are
then
leased
to
the
business.
The
lease
rate
reflects
the
EDC’s
low
cost
of
capital.
The
EDC
has
no
responsibility
for
the
payment
of
interest
and
principal
on
the
debt
except
to
pass
the
business's
rent
payments
through
to
the
investors.

of
equity
(EVE)
One

This
difference
is
a

used
for
capital
when
the
sensitivity
of
capital
to
changes

Effective
interest
amortization
A
methodology
for
amortizing
premiums
or
accreting
discounts
for
MBSs
that
is
required
by
FAS
91.
Under
this
methodology,
premiums
are
amortized
and
discounts
are
accreted
into
income
over
the
average
life
of
the
securities.
To
accomplish
this,
a
prepayment
speed
assumption
(PPA)
must
be
made
when
the
MBS
is
purchased.
An
average
life
is
then
estimated
from
that
prepayment
assumption.
Then
an
initial
accretion
or
amortization
schedule
is
determined
to
evenly
spread
the
accretion
or
amortization
into
income
over
the
estimated
life
of
the
MBS
investment.
If
actual
prepayments
received
during
the
life
of
the
investment
differ
from
the
assumed
speed,
as
they
almost
always
will,
the
average
life
projection
must
be
revised.
When
the
average
life
projection
is
revised,
a
revised
accretion
or
amortization
schedule
must
be
calculated
for
the
entire
period
from
the
purchase
date.
In
practice,
many
investors
do
not
do
this
until
the
difference
between
the
original
speed
assumption
and
a
more
accurate,
current
assumption,
is
material.
An
alternative
system,
level
factor
amortization,
is
often
considered
superior.
Effective
margin
The
effective
margin
is
the
average
spread
over
the
underlying
index
that
the
investor
expects
to
earn
over
the
life
of
a
floating-rate
security.
For
a
floating-rate
security
selling
at
its
par
line,
the
effective
margin
is
identical
to
the
spread
between
the
coupon
rate
and
the
underlying
index.
An
advantage
of
using
an
effective
margin
measurement
is
that
it
applies
equally
well
to
floating-rate
securities
trading
at
discounts,
at
par,
or
at
premiums.
A
security
trading
at
a
discount
will
have
an
effective
margin
greater
than
the
difference
between
the
coupon
rate
and
the
index.

for
the
calculation.

Effective
yield
A
measure
of
the
annual
return
from
an
investment.
The
Effective
yield
is
calculated
by
dividing
the
coupon
interest
rate
by
the
amount
invested
expressed
as
a
percentage
of
the
par
value.
Efficient
asset
or
efficient
portfolio
An

or
portfolio
of
assets
that
earns
the
maximum
possible
return
for
its
given
level
of
risk.
An
asset
or
a
portfolio
of
assets
is
considered
to
be
efficient
if
no
other
asset
or
portfolio
of
assets
offers
a
higher
expected
return
with
the
same
(or
lower)
risk
or
offers
a
lower
risk
with
the
same
(or
higher)
expected
return.
This
concept

part
of
a

explanation
sometimes
called
the
Markowitz
Portfolio
Model
or
the
Efficient

the
expected
returns,
the
standard
deviation
of
returns,
and
the
covariance
of
returns

the
portfolio.

Instead,
they

Endorsement
A
written
statement
on
a
document,
usually
on
the
back
of
the
document,
in
which
the
owner
assigns
his
rights
to
an
individual
or
entity
named
in
the
endorsement.
Endorser
Technically,
an
endorser
is
anyone
who
signs
the
back
of
a
financial
instrument.
In
lending,
the
term
is
used
as
functional
equivalent
of
a
guarantor.
A
loan
endorser
usually
signs
a
guaranty
agreement
included
on
the
promissory
note
form,
often
on
the
back.
Endowment
Funds
or
property
that
are
donated
with
either
a
temporary
or
permanent
restriction
as
to
the
use
of
principal.
Enterprise
fund
(1)
A
fund
established
to
account
for
government
operations
financed
and
operated
in
a
manner
similar
to
private
business
enterprises
(e.g.,
water,
gas,
and
electric
utilities;
airports;
parking
garages;
or
transit
systems).
In
this
case
the
governing
body
intends
that
costs
(i.e.,
expenses,
including
depreciation)
of
providing
goods
or
services
to
the
general
public
on
a
continuing
basis
be
refinanced
or
recovered
primarily
through
user
charges.
(2)
A
fund
established
because
the
governing
body
has
decided
that
periodic
determination
of
revenue
earned,
expenses
incurred,
and/or
net
income
is
appropriate
for
capital
maintenance,
public
policy,
management
control,
accountability,
or
other
purposes.
Enterprise-wide
risk
management
(ERM)
An
integrated
approach
to
measuring
and
managing
risks
within
a
financial
institution.
ERM,
as
opposed
to
traditional
separate,
"silo"
based,
risk
analysis,
recognizes
that
risks
are
inter-related
and
often
have
common
drivers.
For
example,
the
macroeconomic
conditions
related
to
high
interest
rates
impact
credit
risk
in
addition
to
interest
rate
risk.
Moves
to
ERM
are
partially
driven
by
the
Basel
II
capital
guidelines
and
related
rules
issued
by
national
banking
regulators.
Equal
Credit
Opportunity
Act
(ECOA)
A
Federal
statute
that
makes
it
illegal
for
creditors
to
discriminate
in
any
aspect
of
a
credit
transaction
on
the
basis
of
sex,
marital
status,
age,
race,
national
origin,
color,
religion,
receipt
of
public
assistance,
or
the
exercise
of
rights
under
the
Consumer
Protection
Act.
The
Federal
Reserve
Board
of
Governors
has
adopted
Regulation
B
to
implement
this
statute.
Equipment
A
category
of
goods
defined
by
Article
9
of
the
UCC.
Equipment
is
goods
used
primarily
in
the
operation
of
a
business.
It
includes
professional
equipment
and
farm
equipment.
Any
personal
property
that
is
tangible
and
is
not
consumer
goods,
farm
products,
or
inventory.
Equipment
trust
certificates
A
common
type
of
secured
corporate
bond.
For
these
bonds,
a
collateral
interest
in
equipment
or
machinery
provides
extra
protection
for
bond
holders.
In
most
cases,
the
equipment
that
is
pledged
to
secure
the
bonds
is
equipment
or
machinery
that
is
purchased
from
the
proceeds
of
the
bond
issue.
Typically,
a
trustee
will
purchase
the
equipment,
issue
the
bonds,
and
lease
the
equipment
to
the
end
user.
The
end
user's
lease
payments
to
the
trustee
are
passed
to
the
bond
holders
in
the
form
of
interest
and
principal.
When
the
bonds
are
retired,
the
end
user
acquires
title
to
the
equipment.
Airlines,
railroads,
and
shipping
companies
are
the
most
common
issuers.
Equitable
subordination
A
legal
term
used
in
bankruptcy
to
describe
a
process
in
which
a
bankruptcy
judge
decides
that
fairness
can
only
be
achieved
by
giving
lower
priority
(subordinating)
the
claims
of
one
or
more
creditors
(usually
a
secured
bank)
to
the
claims
of
other
(usually
unsecured)
creditors.
Equity
method
An
accounting
method
used
to
reflect
an
investor's
interest
in
a
company.
This
method
is
used
when
the
investor
owns
20
percent
or
more
of
the
investee
and
has
significant
influence
over
the
investee.
Under
the
equity
method,
the
investment
is
originally
recorded
on
the
books
of
the
investor
at
its
cost.
Subsequently,
the
asset
value
of
that
investment
on
the
investor's
financial
statements
is
increased
or
decreased
by
the
investor's
proportionate
share
of
the
increase
or
decrease
in
the
investee's
net
worth.
Equity
security
Any
security
representing
an
ownership
interest
in
the
issuing
entity.
This
includes
common,
preferred,
or
other
capital
stock.
It
also
includes
mutual
funds
and
contractual
rights
to
acquire
or
dispose
of
ownership
interests
at
fixed
or
determinable
prices
such
as
warrants,
rights,
call
options,
and
put
options.
Does
not
include
convertible
debt.
Equity
tranche
One
name
for
the
lowest
quality
(highest
credit
risk)
tranche
in
a
CDO
structure.
Sometimes
called
junior
subordinated
notes,
preferred
stock
or
income
notes.
The
contractual
rules
for
the
cash
flow
distributions
in
a
CDO
structure
enable
the
senior
tranches
to
receive
high
credit
ratings
by
shifting
risk
to
the
equity
tranche.
See
collateralized
debt
obligation
and
waterfall.
Equity
value
at
risk
(EVAR)
A
less-commonly
used
synonym
for
value
at
risk.
The
quantity
by
which
the
assumed
market
value,
or
portfolio
value,
of
an
institution’s
equity
is
projected
to
decline
in
the
event
of
an
adverse
change
in
prevailing
interest
rates.
One
measure
of
an
institution’s
exposure
to
adverse
consequences
from
changes
in
prevailing
interest
rates.

Escrow
accounts
Cash
held
in
abeyance
until
an
event
occurs
or
does
not
occur.
For
example,
funds
paid
monthly
by
a
mortgagor
to
the
mortgagee
are
held
in
escrow
until
they
are

Estoppel
A
legal
term
describing
the
preclusion
of
a
party
from
alleging
in
a
legal
action
anything
that
is
contrary
to
previous
actions
or
admissions
of
that
party.
See
estoppel
letter
or
estoppel
certificate.
Estoppel
letter
or
estoppel
certificate
A
document
used
in
commercial
mortgage
transactions
where
the
lender
is
secured
by
property
that
is
leased
to
tenants.
Also
known
as
tenant
estoppel
letters
or
tenant
acceptance
letters.
Written
admissions
that
are
obtained
by
the
lender
prior
to
funding
to
create
estoppel.
In
an
estoppel
letter,
the
tenants
attest
that
they
believe
the
lease
to
be
valid
and
enforceable,
that
they
are
making
lease
payments
as
agreed,
that
the
landlord
is
not
in
default
of
any
lease
provisions
requiring
landlord
performance
and
that
no
rent
has
been
prepaid.
The
estoppel
letter
gives
the
lender
more
rights
and
more
flexibility
for
disposing
of
the
property
in
the
event
that
the
borrower
defaults.
See
estoppel.
Eurodollar
CDs
One
type
of
Eurodollar
deposit.
The
certificates
are
more
liquid
than
the
time
deposits
and
therefore
trade
at
lower
yields/higher
prices.
Eurodollar
deposits
Bank
deposits
denominated
in
U.S.
dollars
but
held
at
locations
outside
of
the
U.S.
Initially,
the
term
only
referred
to
dollar
deposits
in
London;
later
it
became
applicable
to
dollar
deposits
anywhere
in
Europe
or
the
Caribbean;
now
it
often
refers
to
dollar
deposits
at
any
offshore
location.
The
deposits
may
be
held
by
the
foreign
branches
of
U.S.
banks
or
by
non-U.S.
banks.
Eurodollar
deposits
may
be
Eurodollar
certificates
of
deposit
or
simply
Eurodollar

Evaluation
The
act
or
process
of
estimating
the
market
value
of
real
estate
when
a
transaction
secured
by
real
estate
falls
within
one
or
more
of
the
exemptions
set
forth
to
the
requirements
for
obtaining
a
full
appraisal.
If
a
transaction
falls
under
one
of
three
exemptions,
an
evaluation
is
required.
If
the
transaction
is
exempted
under
one
or
more
exemptions
not
including
one
of
the
three
that
require
an
evaluation,
an
evaluation
may
still
conducted
if
the
lender
considers
it
prudent.
An
evaluation
may
be
conducted
by
independent
bank
personnel
or
by
an
appraiser.
When
an
appraiser
conducts
such
an
estimate
of
value,
it
is
called
a
limited
appraisal
and
must
meet
requirements
for
limited
appraisals.

limited
appraisal
and
Uniform
Standards
of
Professional
Appraisal
Practice

Event
of
default
An
event
described
in
a
promissory
note,
security
agreement,
or
loan
agreement
that
triggers
rights
of
the
lender
to
take
remedies
set
forth
in
the
documents.
The
most
common
event
of
default
is
the
debtor’s
failure
to
make
required
interest
and/or
principal
payments
to
the
bank
when
they
are
due.
Often,
the
remedy
permitted
to
the
bank
when
an
event
of
default
occurs
is
the
right
to
declare
the
debt
to
be
due
and
payable
in
its
entirety.
Formal
loan
agreements
frequently
include
numerous
events
of
default.
Event
risk
The
risk
of
an
unexpected,
future
decrease
in
credit
quality
that
is
a
result
of
events
such
as
a
corporate
acquisition
or
material
changes
in
taxes,
laws,
or
regulations.
Excess
servicing
Excess
spread
A
term
used
in
asset
backed
securities
to
describe
the
amount
by
which
the
yield
from
the
loan
collateral,
net
of
charge-offs,
exceeds
the
sum
of
the
servicing
fee
and
the
interest
paid
to
holders
of
the
security.
Exchange
traded
An
expression
used
to
refer
to
financial
instruments
that
are
purchased
and
sold
in
securities
exchanges
such
as
the
Chicago
Board
of
Trade.
It
excludes
instruments
that
are
actively
traded
in
over-the-counter
(OTC)
capital
markets.
Exchange-traded
derivative
contracts
Some
derivatives
are
traded
on
organized
exchanges.
These
derivatives
usually
have
margin
requirements.
Common
exchange-traded
derivatives
include
futures
and
options.
Other
derivatives,
such
as
swaps,
are
not
exchange
traded
but
are
traded
in
over-the-counter
(OTC)
capital
markets.
Exercise
The
implementation
or
use
of
a
contractual
right,
for
example,
a
call
option
holder’s
purchase
of
the
underlying
security.
Exercise
price
The
price
at
which
an
option
may
be
used.
The
price
at
which
the
owner
of
the
option
has
the
right
to
buy
or
sell
whatever
the
option
contract
is
for.
Sometimes
called
the
strike
price.
Expectations
hypothesis
The
theory
that
the
shape
of
yield
curves
is
determined
by
investors'
collective
expectations
of
future
interest
rates.
See
implied
forward
rates.
Also
see
liquidity
preference
for
a
modification
of
this
interest
rate
theory.
Expected
loss
or
expected
risk
The
portion
or
component
of
risk
or
loss
that
is
predicted
by
statistical
analysis.
Expenditures
Decreases
in
net
financial
resources.
Expenditures
include
current
operating
expenses
requiring
the
present
or
future
use
of
net
current
assets,
debt
service,
and
capital
outlays,
intergovernmental
grants,
entitlements,
and
shared
revenue.
Expenses
Outflows
or
other
reductions
of
assets
or
increases
in
liabilities
(or
a
combination
of
both)
from
delivering
or
producing
goods,
rendering
services,
or
carrying
out
other
activities
that
constitute
the
entity’s
ongoing
major
or
central
operations.
Expiration
date
The
final
date
on
which
an
option
may
be
used.
See
American
option
and
European
option.
Extension
risk
The
risk
that
rising
interest
rates
may
slow
prepayment
speeds
and
therefore
cause
an
investment
in
a
pass-through
or
CMO
MBS
to
last
longer
than
the
investor
anticipated.
By
taking
longer
to
return
the
investor's
principal,
the
extension
of
the
MBS
prevents
the
investor
from
taking
advantage
of
higher
rates
available
from
other
investments.
External
liquidity
risk
A
term
defined
by
the
Federal
Reserve.
The
risk
that
a
bank
will
experience
funding
problems
as
a
result
of
factors
outside
of
its
direct
control.
The
Federal
Reserve
defines
three
types
of
external
liquidity
risk.
These
are
geographic
(such
as
the
premiums
required
on
deposits
at
many
Texas
banks
in
the
late
1980s),
systemic
(such
as
the
adverse
effects
upon
several
large
banks
caused
by
the
near
failure
of
Continental
Illinois
Bank
in
1984),
or
instrument-specific
(such
as
the
collapse
of
the
perpetual
floating-rate
note
market
in
1986.)

Fair
Credit
Reporting
Act
(FCRA)
Consumer
protection
legislation
enacted
in
1968
as
part
of
the
Consumer
Credit
Protection
Act
to
ensure
that
the
banking
system
in
the
United
States
would
have
a
reliable
credit
reporting
system.
The
stated
purpose
of
the
Fair
Credit
Reporting
Act
was
to
require
that
consumer
reporting
agencies
adopt
reasonable
procedures
to
meet
the
needs
of
commerce
for
consumer
credit,
personnel,
insurance,
and
other
information
that
was
fair
and
equitable
to
the
consumer
with
respect
to
the
confidentiality,
accuracy,
relevancy
and
proper
utilization
of
such
information.
One
of
the
most
prominent
requirements
of
the
Act
was
to
establish
the
permissible
purposes
of
the
information
contained
in
a
consumer
report.
In
2003
Congress
updated
the
Fair
Credit
Reporting
Act
when
it
passed
the
Fair
and
Accurate
Transactions
Act,
FACT
Act.
FACT
made
significant
changes
and
expansions
to
the
Fair
Credit
Reporting
Act.

Fair
Credit
Reporting
Act.
Fair
value
An
accounting
term
defined
by
FASB.
The
amount
at
which
an
asset
could
be
bought
or
sold
in
a
current
transaction
between
willing
parties,
that
is,
other
than
in
a
forced
or
liquidation
sale.
Quoted
market
prices
in
active
markets
are
the
best
evidence
of
fair
value
and
should
be
used
as
the
basis
for
the
measurement,
if
available.
If
a
quoted
market
price
is
available,
the
fair
value
is
the
product
of
the
number
of
trading
units
times
that
market
price.
If
a
quoted
market
price
is
not
available,
the
estimate
of
fair
value
should
be
based
on
the
best
information
available
in
the
circumstances.
The
estimate
of
fair
value
should
consider
prices
for
similar
assets
and
the
results
of
valuation
techniques
to
the
extent
available
in
the
circumstances.
Examples
of
valuation
techniques
include
the
present
value
of
estimated
expected
future
cash
flows
using
a
discount
rate
commensurate
with
the
risks
involved,
option-pricing
models,
matrix
pricing,
option-adjusted
spread
models,
and
fundamental
analysis.
Valuation
techniques
for
measuring
assets
should
be
consistent
with
the
objective
of
measuring
fair
value.
Those
techniques
should
incorporate
assumptions
that
market
participants
would
use
in
their
estimates
of
values,
including
assumptions
about
interest
rates,
default,
prepayment,
and
volatility.
(Note
that
the
FASB
definition
in
FAS
115
is
replaced
by
the
definition
in
FAS
133.
Fair
value
hedge
A
type
of
hedge
defined
by
FAS
133.
An
entity
may
designate
a
derivative
instrument
as
hedging
the
exposure
to
changes
in
the
fair
value
of
an
asset
or
a
liability,
or
a
portion
of
an
asset
or
a
liability.
Certain
requirements
must
be
met
to
qualify
for
fair
value
hedge
accounting.
Changes
in
the
fair
market
value
of
the
derivative
instrument
in
qualifying
fair
value
hedges
are
recorded
and
reported
in
earnings.
At
the
same
time,
gains
or
losses
associated
with
the
hedged
risk
are
also
recognized
in
current
earnings.
The
carrying
value
(book
value)
of
hedged
asset/liability
must
be
adjusted
commensurately
with
resulting
basis
adjustment,
producing
a
prospective
yield
adjustment
thus
offsetting
the
related
derivative
loss/gain
in
the
same
accounting
period.

Federal
funds
Short-term
investments/borrowings
between
banks,
usually
called
fed
funds.
The
investing/lending
bank
refers
to
the
transaction
as
fed
funds
sold
while
the
borrowing
bank
refers
to
the
transaction
as
fed
funds
purchased.
Despite
its
name,
these
transactions
are
not
loans
to
or
from
the
federal
government.
Nor
do
they
include
any
guarantee
or
backing
from
the
federal
government.
They
are
only
called
federal
funds
because
the
parties
exchange
the
funds
by
transferring
balances
from
the
lender's
account
with
its
Federal
Reserve
District
Bank
to
the
borrower's

collateral
may
be
referred
to
as

date
The

possible
date
on
which
an
MBS
holder
receives
payment.
Because
mortgage
loans
tend
to
be
repaid
sooner
than
their

A
lease
in
which
the
lessor
is
not
the
supplier
or
manufacturer
of
the
leased
goods.
In
a

lease,
the
lessor
must
not
have
any
involvement
in
the
selection
of
the
leased
goods
and
it
must
be
serving
only
as
a
conduit
for
the
lessee
to
obtain
the
goods.
Finally,
the
lessor
must
acquire
the
goods
or
the
right
to
possess
the
goods
in
connection
with
the
lease.

Financial
Institutions
Reform,
Recovery,
and
Enforcement
Act
(FIRREA)
A
federal
law
enacted
in
1989.
FIRREA
primarily
addresses
the
operation
of
savings
and
loan
associations;
however,
it
includes
a
number
of
important
provisions
affecting
commercial
banks.
Arguably
the
most
important
FIRREA
provisions
affecting
banks
are
those
that
address
requirements
for
real
estate
appraisals.
Financial
instrument
Cash,
evidence
of
ownership
in
an
entity
(e.g.,
stock),
a
contract
that
creates
a
right
or
obligation
to
receive
or
deliver
cash
(e.g.,
notes
and
bonds),
or
a
contract
that
creates
a
right
or
obligation
to
receive
or
deliver
another
financial
instrument
or
commodity
(e.g.,
options
and
futures).
Financial
intermediary
A
party
such
as
a
bank
or
other
financial
institution
that
accepts
funds
from
a
provider
and
places
those
funds
with
a
user.
The
intermediary's
investment
from
the
user
is
usually
for
a
longer
term,
usually
has
less
liquidity,
and
usually
has
more
credit
risk
than
the
intermediary's
liability
to
the
provider.
Financial
statements
Collective
name
for
historical
financial
reports
of
assets,
liabilities,
capital,
income,
and
expense.
Financing
statements
Forms,
usually
standard
UCC-1
forms,
that
are
required
by
Article
9
of
the
UCC
to
be
recorded
in
a
designated
public
location
in
order
to
perfect
a
creditor’s
lien
in
personal
property
collateral.
The
financing
statement
is
used
as
a
vehicle
for
a
public
recording
that
establishes
lien
priority
—
it
does
not
normally
constitute
the
actual
agreement
between
the
secured
party
and
the
debtor.
For
that
reason,
the
financing
statement
by
itself
does
not
create
a
security
interest
and
must
therefore
be
supported
by
a
separate
security
agreement
or
pledge
agreement.
Firm
commitment
An
agreement
with
an
unrelated
party
that
is
binding
on
both
parties
and
that
is
usually
legally
enforceable.
In
FAS
133,
FASB
specifies
that
the
following
are
both
satisfied
for
a
firm
commitment:
a)
The
agreement
specifies
all
significant
terms,
including
the
quantity
to
be
exchanged,
the
price
at
which
the
quantity
will
be
exchanged,
and
the
timing
of
the
transaction.
b)
The
agreement
includes
a
disincentive
for
nonperformance
that
is
sufficiently
large
to
make
performance
probable.

A

Fixed-period
ARM
MBSs
that
are
fixed-rate
instruments
for
an
initial
period
and
floating-rate
securities
thereafter.
The
initial,
fixed-rate
period
may
be
3,
5,
7,
or
10
years.
After
the
expiration
of
the
fixed-rate
period,
a
typical
fixed-period
ARM
may
adjust
annually
at
a
margin
over
the
one-year
Treasury

Some
fixed-period
ARMs
have
rates
tied

LIBOR.
Fixtures
Fixtures
are
items
that
become
attached
to
real
property.
Examples
are
heating
and
air
conditioning
systems,
wall-mounted
shelving,
and
security
alarm
systems.
Lenders
must
be
extremely
cautious
about
what
constitutes
a
fixture.
As
a
general
rule,
an
item
may
be
considered
goods
before
it
becomes
attached
to
a
building,
but
becomes
a
fixture
after
it
is
attached.
Once
affixed
to
real
property,
goods
may
be
subject
to
laws
governing
real
estate
collateral
rather
than
rules
under
Article
9
of
the
UCC.

Flex
repo
A
term
repo/reverse
transaction
that
allows
for
the
investor
to
sell
some
of
the
collateral
securities
back
to
the
borrower
before
the
final
maturity
date
of
the
transaction.
Flex
repos
are
well
suited
to
construction
projects
for
which
bond
proceeds
need
to
be
invested
until
payment
is
due
for
each
stage
of
construction.
Usually,
the
timing
of
the
loan
payments
is
subject
to
considerable
uncertainty.
The
flex
repo
investment
has
a
draw-down
schedule
for
reducing
the
size
of
the
investment;
however,
the
investor
is
not
required
to
adhere
to
it
rigidly.
In
return
for
the
added
flexibility,
investors
in
flex
repos
almost
always
receive
slightly
lower
rates
of
return
than
investors
in
repos
with
terms
that
are
more
traditional.
Flight
to
quality
The
situation
in
which
many
investors
sell
or
reduce
purchases
of
less
creditworthy
investments
and
simultaneously
buy
or
increase
purchases
of
the
most
creditworthy
investments.
Flights
to
quality
often
occur
suddenly
after
a
major
unexpected
default
or
a
major
political
event.
Float
The
use
of
funds
generated
as
a
result
of
timing
differences
in
the
check-clearing
system.
For
banks,
float
occurs
because
debits
given
by
the
Federal
Reserve
to
a
bank's
reserve
account
for
checks
being
cleared
can
be
received
prior
to
the
time
that
the
bank
allows
the
customer
who
presented
the
check
to
use
the
funds.
For
depositors,
float
occurs
because
credits
may
be
given
for
checks
deposited
or
tendered
for
payment
before
the
depositor's
accounts
are
debited.

An
analysis
of
an

of
days
between

of

Floater
An
informal
name
for
a
security
with
a
variable
coupon
rate.
Particularly
used
to
refer
to
floating-rate
CMO
tranches.
Floating
lien
The
name
for
and
the
nature
of
a
creditor's
interest
in
a
debtor's
accounts
receivable
and
inventory.
In
the
natural
operation
of
any
business,
the
specific
receivables
and
inventory
owned
at
one
point
in
time
are
replaced
over
time
by
new
receivables
and
new
inventory.
Thus
a
creditor’s
security
interest
in
accounts
receivable
and
inventory
floats
from
the
specific
accounts
and
inventory
held
today
to
that
held
next
week,
next
month,
and
thereafter.
Floating-rate
note
(FRN)
A
medium-term
instrument
with
a
coupon
rate
that
floats
up
or
down
based
upon
changes
to
an
index
or
reference
rate.
Often,
FRNs
are
tied
to
LIBOR.
Flood
hazard
zone
A
geographic
area
officially
designated
under
Federal
law
as
an
area
that
might
experience
damage
from
flooding.
Under
the
National
Flood
Insurance
Reform
Act
of
1994,
lenders
taking
an
interest
in
real
property
are
required
to
complete
a
standard
flood
hazard
determination
form
developed
by
the
Federal
Emergency
Management
Agency
(FEMA).
Flood
hazard
forms
must
be
retained
in
the
lender’s
records.
If
the
form
indicates
that
the
property
is
in
a
designated
flood
hazard
zone,
the
lender
is
required
to
have
flood
insurance
protection.
Lenders
may
also
have
notice
requirement
obligations
for
collateral
located
in
flood
hazard
zones.
Flood
insurance
Insurance
protection
against
damage
caused
by
floods.
For
applicable
parcels
of
real
estate,
lenders
with
a
security
interest
in
that
real
estate
are
required
by
law
to
either
require
that
borrowers
obtain
flood
insurance
or
to
obtain
flood
insurance
for
their
borrowers.
See
flood
hazard

Floor
A
lower
limit
for
a
variable,
such
as
the
lower
limit
on
an
interest
rate
paid
or
received
in
a
transaction.
For
example,
an
adjustable-rate
loan
may
have
a
floor
of
5
percent.
In
that
example,
the
rate
can
adjust
however
loan
terms
provide,
but
it
can
never
fall
below
5
percent.
The
term
"floor"
is
often
used
with
its
converse,
a
cap.
A
floor
may
be
an
embedded
option,
such
as
the
floor
on
the
rate
for
a
floating-rate
loan,
or
a
stand-alone
option
contract.

U.S.
Treasury
bonds
that
can
be
applied
at
par
toward
the
payment
of
U.S.
inheritance
taxes.
The
Treasury
stopped
issuing
flower
bonds
in
1977.
The
last
flower
bond
matured
in
1998.
Flux
A
measure
of
the
sensitivity
of
CMO
cash
flows
to
changes
in
the
prepayment
rate
of
the
underlying
MBS
collateral.
Derived
from
flow
uncertainty
index.
Developed
by
the
National
Association
of
Insurance
Commissioners
to
create
a
standard
measure
of
CMO
volatility.
A
flux
score
is
a
composite
of
two
elements
that
indicate
the
impact
of
six
prepayment
scenarios
on
a
bond’s
present
value
and
on
the
timing
of
its
cash
flows.
That
impact
is
expressed
in
terms
of
variation
from
a
base
case.
Flux
scores
are
calculated
once
each
year
in
January.
A
flux
score
of
0
indicates
no
cash
flow
uncertainty.
(Rather
than
a
lack
of
interest
rate
risk,
this
score
indicates
that
the
amount
and
timing
of
the
cash

are
known.)

Food
Security
Act
of
1985
A
Federal
law
that
preempts
state
laws
including
the
UCC
as
they
apply
to
farm
products.
The
law
allows
certain
buyers
to
obtain
clear

to
farm
products
regardless
of
security
interests
that

Forbearance
agreement
An
agreement
between
a
creditor
and
a
debtor.
A
forbearance
agreement
is
utilized
when
a
debtor
has
defaulted
or
is
likely
to
default.
Under
the
terms
of
the
forbearance
agreement,
the
debtor
is
given
more
time
to
make
loan
payments,
a
reduction
in
the
amount
of
loan
payments
due
each
month
or
both.
Typically,
the
lender
agrees
not
to
exercise
rights
to
foreclose
or
accelerate
during
the
forbearance
period.
In
return,
the
debtor
agrees
not
to
contest
any
actions
taken
by
the
creditor
to
collect
the
debt
in
the
event
that
the
debtor
fails
to
comply
with
the
payment
schedule
or
other
terms
specified
in
the
forbearance
agreement.
In
some
forbearance
agreements,
the
debtor
may
grant
the
creditor
a
deed
in
lieu
of
foreclosure
if
the
terms
of
the
forbearance
agreement
are
not
met.
Sometimes
called
a
drop
dead
agreement.
Forced
placed
insurance
Insurance
purchased
by
a
creditor
covering
personal
or
real
property
owned
by
debtor.
In
some
cases,
forced
placed
flood
insurance
is
required
by
law.
In
other
cases,
creditors
are
granted
the
right
to
force
place
insurance
by
provisions
in
loan
agreements,
security
agreements,
and/or
mortgages.
Forced
placed
insurance
is
almost
exclusively
purchased
when
the
debtor
refuses
to
obtain
or
renew
required
insurance
coverage.
Forecasted
transaction
An
accounting
term
defined
by
FASB
in
FAS
133.
A
transaction
that
is
expected
to
occur
but
for
which
there
is
no
firm
commitment.
Because
no
transaction
or
event
has
yet
occurred
and
because
the
transaction
or
event,
when
it
occurs,
will
be
at
the
current
prevailing
market
price,
a
forecasted
transaction
does
not
give
an
entity
any
present
rights
to
future
benefits
or
a
present
obligation
for
future
sacrifices.
Foreclosure
A
remedy
provided
by
state
law
for
creditors
secured
by
an
interest
in
real
property
to
obtain
title
to
the
property
under
certain
conditions.
Foreign

the
OCC.
The
risk
to
earnings
or
capital
arising
from
adverse
movement
of
foreign
exchange
rates.
The
Federal
Reserve
includes
this
risk
in
its
definition
of
market
risk.
Forward
cash
exposure
(FCE)
A
term
sometimes
used

The
informal
(nonexchange)
trading
of
foreign
exchange
or
commodities
to
be
delivered

that
is
very
similar
to
the
one
that

Forwards
Contracts
for
the
sale/purchase
of
a
specified
quantity
of
a
financial
instrument,
currency,
or
commodity
at
an
agreed-upon

on
a
given
future
date.
Unlike
an

Sometimes
brokers
and
dealers
only
quote
the
numbers
to
the
right
of
the
decimal
point
and
assume
that
the
handle
is
understood.
Hard
call
protection
For
convertible
bonds,
one
of
two
types

Hard
call
protection
prohibits
an
issuer
from
calling
an
issue
within
a
certain
period
of
time.
For
convertible
bonds,
hard
call
protection
is

three
years,
but
can
range
from
two
to
five

A
category
of
personal
property
collateral
defined
by
the
2001
revisions
to
Article
9
of
the
UCC.
Hedge
(1)
Verb—
To
reduce
risk
or
behavior
that
reduces
risk
from
future
price
movements.
(2)
Noun
—
A
transaction
undertaken
to
reduce
risk
by
offsetting
the
risk
in
another
transaction.
The
risk
in
one
position
is
hedged
by
counterbalancing
it
with
the
risk
in
another
transaction.
The
values
of
each
position
must
change
inversely
and
with
a
high
degree
of
correlation.
Hedges
may
be
cash
to
cash
in
which
a
position
in
a
cash
instrument
such
as
a
loan
or
investment
reduces
or
offsets
the
risk
in
another
cash
position
such
as
a
deposit.
For
example,
a
$1,000,000
investment
in
a
U.S.
Treasury
bond
maturing
in
10
years
and
a
$1,000,000
certificate
of
deposit
are
largely
(but
not
completely)
offsetting
risks.
Hedges
may
also
be
cash
to
futures
or
futures
to
futures.
Hedge
accounting
Deferring
recognition
of
unrealized
gains
and
losses
from
a
hedge
instrument
until
the
corresponding
gains
or
losses
from
the
hedged
instrument(s)
are
recognized.
See
FAS
133
and
FAS
149.
Hedge
effectiveness
The
extent
to
which
a
hedge
transaction
results
in
the
offsetting
changes
in
value
or
cash
flow
that
the
transaction
was
and
is
intended
to
provide.
FAS
133
requires
users
to
regularly
assess
the
effectiveness
of
hedges.
Furthermore,
under
FAS
133
only
the
portion
of
a
transaction
that
is
deemed
effective
may
qualify
for
hedge
accounting
treatment.
Under
FAS
133,
any
part
of
fair
value
changes
in
a
derivative
that
are
not
perfectly
correlated
with
the
fair
value
(or
variable
cash
flow)
changes
of
the
hedged
item
must
be
reported
in
current
earnings.
FAS
133
does
not
delineate
a
specific
methodology
for
assessing
whether
a
hedge
is
expected
to
be
highly
effective
or
for
measuring
hedge
ineffectiveness.
Hedge
effectiveness
is
a
very
broad
concept,
and
FASB
believes
each
company
must
define
it
relative
to
the
intent
of
its
hedging
activities.
The
only
requirement
is
that
there
be
a
reasonable
basis
for
assessing
hedge
effectiveness.
The
focus
on
hedge
effectiveness
in
FAS
133
contributes
to
a
significant
difference
between
previous
practice
and
the
new
accounting
standard.
Whereas
the
earnings
effect
of
minor
hedge
ineffectiveness
was
spread
over
the
life
of
the
hedge
in
the
past,
the
FAS
133
rules
result
in
anything
other
than
perfect
correlation
being
recorded
in
current
earnings.
Thus
under
FAS
133
there
is
the
potential
(and
even
likelihood)
that
hedges
may
have
both
an
effective
component
and
an
ineffective
component
even
for
a
highly
effective
hedge.
The
fact
that
some
portion
of
a
derivative
is
ineffective
does
not
preclude
a
hedge
from
being
deemed
highly
effective.
See
cash
flow
hedge,
fair
value
hedge,
and
FAS
133.
Hedge
ratio
The
relationship
between
the
size
of
a
position
needed
in
a
hedge
instrument
and
the
size
of
the
position
being
hedged.
The
hedge
ratio
is
determined
by
the
delta.
Held-to-maturity
(HTM)
One
of
three
defined
categories
established
in
FAS
115
for
the
classification
of
financial
instruments
held
as
assets
on
the
books
of
an
investor.
HTM
securities
are
those
the
investor
intends
to
hold
to
maturity
and
is
able
to
hold
to
maturity.
Designation
of
a
security
as
HTM
allows
the
investor
to
report
the
security
value
at
historical
cost
plus
accretion
or
minus
amortization.
Unrealized
gains
or
losses
are
not
shown
on
the
balance
sheet,
reflected
in
reported
income,
or
reflected
in
reported
net
worth.
FAS
115
imposes
conditions
that
restrict
an
investor’s
flexibility
to
remove
securities
from
the
HTM
category.
See
available-for-sale,
FAS
115,

Hidden
option
An
option
feature
in
an
instrument
in
which
the
option
feature
is
only
a
minor
feature
of
that
product.
Sometimes
called
an
embedded
option.
They
are
hidden
because
they
are
not
separate,
detachable
features
that
issuers
or
holders
can
add
or
subtract
to
customize
individual
transactions.
Instead,
they
are
one
part
of
a
number
of
features
embedded
in
the
product.
High-grade

Histogram
A
table
or
bar
chart
displaying
a
probability
distribution.
All
of
the
probabilities
in
the
histogram
total
to
100
percent.
The
frequency
of
the
data
for
each
interval
is
represented
by
the
height
of
the
bar.
The
technique
can
be
used
to
combine
a
group
of
individual
rate
forecasts
to
obtain
a
single
probability
weighted
average
of
the
various
subjective
predictions
for
interest
rates.
Historical
VAR
A
measure
of
a
financial
instrument’s,
a
portfolio
of
financial
instruments’,
or
an
entity’s
exposure
to
reductions
in
value
resulting
from
changes
in
prevailing
interest
rates.
Historical
VAR
is
one
of
several
different
methods
for
calculating
VAR.
Historical
VAR
calculates
value
at
risk
by
comparing
the
actual
volatility
of
components
or
risk
elements
within
a
portfolio
to
the
historical
sensitivity
of
those
components.
This
provides
a
range
or
distribution
of
possible
losses.
A
single
value
at
risk
can
then
be
calculated
for
the
selected
confidence
level.
Historical
VAR
is
generally
preferred
for
its
ability
to
capture
risk
from
unlikely
events.
However,
the
measured
amount
of
VAR
is
heavily
influenced
by
the
choice
of
time
horizon
and
by
the
volatility
that
occurred
during
that
historical
time
period.
If
future
changes
do
not
resemble
the
change
in
value
that
occurred
during
the
selected
time
horizon,
the
forecasted
VAR
will

Horizon
analysis
A
less-common
name
for
total
return
analysis.
The
term
"horizon
analysis"
derives
from
the
fact
that
total
return
analysis
requires
the
user
to
select
an
ending
date
for
the
investment
being
analyzed.
That
ending
date
is
sometimes
called
the
investor's
horizon.

Immobilized
A
physical

representing
ownership
of
a
security
(a
stock
certificate
or
bond)
that
is
held
by
a
trustee.
An
arrangement
through
which
a
physical
certificate
is
held
so
that
all
future
transactions
can
be
conducted
as
if
the

were
book
entry.
Ownership
and
liens
are
recorded
in
the
books
of
the
trustee
rather
than
evidenced
by
physical
possession
of

Also
called
dematerialized.
Immunization
Establishing
and
maintaining
equal
and
offsetting
exposures
to
interest
rate
risk.
For
example,
holding
equal
amounts
of
assets
and
liabilities
of
the
same
duration.
Implied
forward
rates
Indicated
future
interest
rates
derived
from
the
differences
between
current
rates
for
different
maturities
of
the
same
instrument.
Yield
curves
include
implied
information
about
future
interest
rates.
For
example,
suppose
that
a
2-year
investment
offers
a
return
of
6
percent
while
an
otherwise
identical
1–year
investment
offers
a
return
of
5
percent.
In
this
case,
an
investor
who
bought
the
1-year
investment
and
realized
a
return
of
5
percent
for
the
first
year
would
have
to
be
able
to
reinvest
his
money
at
7
percent
in
the
second
year
in
order
to
get
an
average
2-year
return
of
6
percent.
If
the
investor
gets
less
than
7
percent
in
the
second
year,
he
will
not
do
as
well
as
the
investor
who
purchased
the
2-year
investment.
This
implies
that
the
rate
for
1-year
investments
that
will
be
available
one
year
in
the
future
will
be
7
percent.
Implied

Volatility
of
a

by
subtracting
all
of
the
other
factors
thought
to

to
the

of
an

The

lost
the

Indemnification
agreement
An
agreement
in
which
the
borrower
promises
to
protect
the
bank
or
reimburse
the
bank
for
any
damages,
claims,
costs,
penalties,
or
liabilities
that
may
arise
from
some
problem.
For
example,
the
bank
may
obtain
an
indemnification
agreement
to
protect
itself
from
costs,

Index
A
benchmark
upon
which
the
payment
rate
or
accrual
rate
for
an
adjustable-rate
loan
or
investment
is
based.
For
example,
a
business
loan
may
pay
interest
at
the
prime
rate
plus
1
percent.
In
that
example,
the
prime
rate
is
the
index.
For
adjustable-rate
residential
mortgage
loans,
federal
law
requires
that
indexes
must
move
independently
(not
controlled
by
the

and
that
indexes
must
be
easily
confirmed

Index
amortizing
note
(IAN)
Securities
which

schedule
that
is
linked
to
the
level
of
a

or
a

rate.
As
market
interest
rates
increase
or

such
as
a

Indirect
costs
In
cost
accounting
applications,
the
share
of
costs
imputed,
attributed
or
allocated
to
the
cost
center
or
product
being
measured.
Indirect
leases
A
form
of
lease
financing
in
which
the
bank
acquires
or
finances
a
lease
transaction
entered
into
by
an
end
user
and
a
third
party.
The
third
party
is
the
lessor
and
the
end
user
is
the
lessee.
The
bank
is
the
lender
to
the
third
party
if
it
merely
finances
the
transaction
or
the
assignee
of
the

Development
Authority
(IDA)
Special
types
of
municipal
authorities
established

promote
economic
development
in
their
communities.
A
community
establishes
an
Industrial
Development
Authority
to
act
as
a
conduit.
The
authority
can,
as
a
municipal
entity,
borrow
funds
or
sell
securities
that
are,
in
most
cases,
exempt
from
federal
income
tax.
Consequently,
the
authority
can
raise
funds
at
lower
interest
rates
than
businesses.
The
lower-cost
funds
are
used
by
the
authority
to
buy
fixed
assets
that
are
then
leased
to
the
business.
The
lease
rate
reflects
the
authority’s
low
cost
of
capital.

Insecurity
clause
A
provision
found
in
some
promissory
notes
that
attempts
to
give
the
lender
the
right
to
demand
payment
in
full
at
any
time
the
lender
deems
itself
insecure.
More
often
than
not,
such
a
clause
is
unenforceable
except
when
other
material
defaults
are
also
involved.
Insiders
A
legal
term
used
in
bankruptcy
to
describe
parties
that
have
a
special
relationship
to
the
bankrupt
debtor.
Creditors
who
are
officers,
directors,
or
stockholders
are
obvious
examples
of
insiders.
In
some
cases,
the
bank
may
be
deemed
to
be
an
insider.
The
main
consequence
of
being
deemed
an
insider
is
that
insiders
are
subject
to
a
one-year
preference
period
while
other
creditors
are
only
subject
to
a
90-day
preference
period.

preference.
Insolvency
The
lack
of
adequate
capital.
The
condition
that
exists
when
the
amount
of
losses
exceeds
the
amount
of
capital.

that
the
failure
of
a

for
a
financial
instrument,
such
as

Instruments
A
category
of
personal

9
of
the
Uniform
Commercial
Code.
Instruments
are
notes,

and
any
other
written
evidence
of
rights

that,
in

is
not
legally
released
from
being
the

on
the

but
the
possibility
of
the

Intangible
pension
asset
An
asset
booked
to
offset
the
additional
minimum
pension
obligation.
This
asset
is
created
under
the
FAS
87
rules
to
offset
the
minimum
liability
for
underfunded
plans
that
FAS
87
required
firms
to
recognize
as
a
liability.
Little
or
no
justification
can
be
made
to
support
the
classification
of
this
debit
as
an
asset;
it
is
conceptually
more
accurate
to
consider
it
as
a
reduction
to
equity.
Intangibles
An
informal
term
used
by
secured
lenders
to
refer
to
the
categories
of
personal
property
defined
by
Article
9
of
the
Uniform
Commercial
Code
as
accounts
and
general
intangibles.
Intercompany
accounts
Accounts

Accounting
entries
made
on
consolidating

Interest
(1)
A
monetary
benefit
paid
by
a
borrower
for
the
right
to
use
a
lender’s
or
a
depositor’s
funds.
Usually,
the
interest
is
paid
periodically
over
the
life
of
the
loan,
deposit,
or
security.
However,
some
interest-bearing
instruments,
such
as
savings
accounts,
do
not
have
defined
maturities.
Under
the
terms
of
some
instruments,
interest
is
not
paid
periodically
over
the
life
of
the
instrument
but
instead
is
paid
solely
at
the
end
of
the
loan/deposit/security
term.
(2)
A
right
to
enjoy
some
benefits
of
ownership
of
property.
For
example,
the
rights
that

Interest-coverage
ratio
A
ratio
that
uses
historical
financial
information.
sometimes
combined
with
projected
financial
information,
to
measure
a
firm's
short-term
credit
strength.
This
ratio
measures
the
firm's
ability
to
make
its
required
interest
payments.
In
its
simplest
form,
the
ratio
takes
the
firm's
pretax
net
income
plus
interest
expense
and
divides
that
sum
by
the
interest
expense.
Interest-coverage
ratios
can
be
calculated
with
several
variations.
One
variation
involves
using
next
year's
projected
interest
expense
in
the
denominator
rather
than
the
most
recent
year's
actual
interest
expense.
A
second
variation
reduces
net
income
by
deducting
nonrecurring
income
amounts.
Other
variations
are
in
use.
Sometimes
called
times
interest
earned.
Interest-only
strip
(I/O)
A
form
of
stripped
mortgage-backed
security
(MBS)
that
only
passes
interest
payments
received
from
the
underlying
mortgage
loans
to
the
security
owners.
May
be
a
real

Interest
rate
risk
(IRR)
The
potential
that
changes
in
market
rates
of
interest
will
reduce
earnings
and/or
capital.
The
risk
that
changes
in
prevailing
interest
rates
will
adversely
affect
assets,
liabilities,
capital,
income,
and/or
expense
at
different
times
or
in
different
amounts.
The
Federal
Reserve
calls
this
type
of
risk
market
risk
and
defines
it
as
the
risk
to
a
financial
institution’s
condition
resulting
from
adverse
movements
in
market
rates
or
prices,
such
as
interest
rates,
foreign
exchange
rates,
or
equity
prices.
Within
that
definition,
the
Federal
Reserve
clearly
views
interest
rate
risk
as
just
one
component
of
market
risk.
The
Office
of
the
Comptroller
of
the
Currency
(OCC)
defines
interest
rate
a
bit
more
narrowly
than
the
Federal
Reserve
since
it
defines
price
risk
as
a
separate
risk.
The
OCC
defines
price
risk
as
the
risk
to
earnings
or
capital
arising
from
adverse
changes
in
the
value
of
portfolios
of
financial
instruments.
Since
such
adverse
changes
generally
result
from
changes
in
prevailing
interest
rates,
price
risk
is
essentially
the
same
as
interest
rate
risk.
Most
rate
risk
managers
use
the
term
in
the
broadest
sense
as
defined
in
the
first
sentence
of
this
paragraph.
Interest
rate
risk
has
four
components.
See
basis
risk,
mismatch
risk,
option
risk
and
yield
curve
risk.
Closely
related
to
price
risk
and
market
risk.
Interest
rate
swap
A
financial
instrument
representing
a
transaction
in
which
two
parties
agree
to
swap
or
exchange
net
cash
flows,
on
agreed-upon
dates,
for
an
agreed-upon
period
of
time,
for
interest
on
an
agreed-upon
principal
amount.
The
agreed-upon
principal
amount,
called
the
notional
amount,
is
never
exchanged.
Only
the
net
interest
cash
flows
are
remitted.
In
the
simplest
form
of
interest
rate
swap,
one
party
agrees
to
swap
fixed-rate
loan
payments
with
the
floating-rate
payments
of
the
other
party.
Interest
rate
swaps
are
often
used
in
hedging.

Financial
statements

Also
called
administrative
float
or
processing
float.
Internal
liquidity
risk
A
term
defined
by
the
Federal
Reserve.
Internal
liquidity
risk
relates
largely
to
funding
problems
arising
from
unfavorable
changes
in
the
perception
of
an
institution
in
its
various
markets:
local,
regional,
national,
or
international.

bank-specific
liquidity
risk,
external
liquidity
risk
and

Internal
rate
of
return
(IRR)
A
measure
of
yield
that
relates
the
cash
flow
from
each
interest
payment
and
the
cash
flow
from
the
investment's
redemption
value
at
maturity
to
the
purchase
price
of
the
investment.
It
is
a
present
value
calculation
that
reflects
the
time
value
of
each
of
those
cash
flows.
By
calculating
the
present
value
of
the
cash
flows,
the
IRR
reflects
the
reinvestment
income
that
the
investor
can
earn
from
reinvesting
those
cash
flows,
at
the
same
yield
as
the
investment
that
generated
them,
during
the
life
of
the
investment.

Interpolation
The
mathematical
process
of
obtaining
an
unknown
number
that
has
a
value
between
two
known
numbers
in
a
series
of
numbers.
For
example,
if
the
yields
or
prices
for
2-,
3-,
and
5-year
Treasury
notes
are
known,
a
yield
or
price
for
4-year
Treasury
notes
can
be
extrapolated
or
interpolated.
Interpolated
values
are
not
always
correct,
but
they
are
usually
close
enough
for
most
users.
Intrinsic
value
That
portion
of
an
option’s
value
that
derives
from
the
fact
that
the
option
is
in
the
money.
The
difference
between
exercise
price
of
the
option
and
the
price
of
the
underlying.
The
other
primary
component
of
an
option's
price
is
its

Inverse
floater
Bonds
whose
coupon
rates
increase
as

decline
and
decrease
as

Investment
grade
A
term
defined
by
the
Office
of
Comptroller
of
the
Currency
(OCC)
(12
CFR
1)
and
used
in
its
investment
regulation
to
define
eligible
investments.
Investment
grade
means
a
security
that
is
rated
in
one
of
the
four
highest
rating
categories
by
either:
(1)
Two
or
more
nationally
recognized
statistical
rating
organizations
(NRSROs);
or
(2)
One
NRSRO
if
the
security
has
only
been
rated
by
one
NRSRO.

Investment
premium
(for
convertible
bonds)
The
amount
by
which
it’s
the
convertible
bond’s
market
price
exceeds
its
value
as
a
bond
only,
expressed
as
a
percentage.
The
calculation
is
done
by
subtracting
the
investment
value
from
the
market
value
and
dividing
the
difference
by
the
investment
value.

Investment
security
As
defined
by
the
Office
of
the
Comptroller
of
the
Currency
(OCC)
(12
CFR
1),
a
marketable
debt
obligation
that
is
not
predominantly
speculative
in
nature.
A
security
is
not
predominantly
speculative
in
nature
if
it
is
rated
investment
grade.
When
a
security
is
not
rated,
the
security
must
be
the
credit
equivalent
of
a
security
rated
investment
grade.
See
marketable
and
investment
grade.
Investment
value
(for
convertible
bonds)
The
value
of
a
convertible
bond
calculated
as
a
straight
bond
without
giving
any
value
to
the
conversion
feature.
Although
this
is
done
according
to
normal
bond
calculations,
the
rate
used
to
discount
the
bond
is
that
for
similar,
nonconvertible
debt.
The
discount
rate
is
likely
to
be
two
to
five
percentage
points
higher
than
the
convertible’s
coupon
rate.

ISDA
master
agreement
a.k.a.
the
ISDA
An
industry-standard
agreement
used
between
the
counterparties
to
privately
negotiated
(i.e.,
nonexchange
traded)
derivatives
transactions.
The
body
of
the
master
agreement"
presents
the
most
common
legal
and
operating
terms
and
conditions
that
could
apply
to
derivatives
transactions
between
parties
to
the
agreement.
These
include
basic
representations,
events
of
default
and
termination
events,
numerous
contractual
housekeeping
items,
and
a
list
of
key
definitions.
The
provisions
in
the
master
agreement
itself
are
non-negotiable
so
users
customize
the
agreement
in
the
"schedule",
selecting
from
terms
provided
in
the
master
agreement
or
adding
new
provisions.
The
schedule
contains
a
number
of
optional
provisions
that
counterparties
can
choose
to
select
or
add.
A
third
and
final
part
of
the
ISDA
is
a
"Credit
Support
Annex"
(CSA),that
details
the
terms
of
certain
credit
support
required
in
the
Agreement.
Issue
date
The
date
on
which
interest
for
a
new
security
issue
begins
accruing.
For
mortgage-backed
bonds,
the
issue
date
of
the
pool
is
not
the
same
as
the
origination
date
of
the
underlying
mortgages.
A
pool
may
be
assembled
from
new
loans
or
from
older
loans.
Issuer
A
party
or
entity
that
sells
a
security
representing
a
claim
on
its
assets
(an
equity
security)
or
its
contractual
obligation
to
pay
the
holder
at
a
future
date
(a
debt
security).
Joint
and
several
A
legal
expression
used
to
indicate
that
two
or
more
parties
each
are
fully
liable
rather
than
together
fully
liable.
For
example,
if
two
individuals
execute
joint
and
several
guaranties,
either
one
can
be
asked
to
repay
the
entire
amount
of
the
guaranteed
debt.
Judgment
A
sum
due
for
payment
or
collection
as
a
result
of
a
court
order.
Judgment
clause
A
provision
in
bank
promissory
notes
or
guaranties.
In
this
clause,
the
borrowers
or
guarantors
authorize
the
bank
to
create
a
judgment
lien
at
any
time
after
the
documents
have
been
executed.
The
bank
only
has
to
take
the
documents
to
a
court.
Many
states
prohibit
judgment
clauses.
Judgment
lien
See

lien.
Judicial
lien
An
interest
in
property
acquired
from
a
judicial
or
court
proceeding.
A
judicial
lien
is
usually
the
result
of
a
judgment
that
a
winning
party
of
a
lawsuit
receives
in
the
form
of
a
court
order.

Key
rate
duration
A
measure
of
duration
that
calculates
effective
or
empirical
duration
by
changing
the
market
rate
for
one
specific
maturity
point
on
the
yield
curve
while
holding
all
other
variables
constant.
May
be
done
as
part
of
a
series
of
calculations
that
separately
and
sequentially
vary
the
yields
for
two
or
more
maturity
points
on
the
yield
curve.
Sets
of
partial
durations
for
multiple
points
on
the
same
yield
curve
will
sum
to
a
value
that
is
usually
close
to
the
overall
effective
duration.
Also
known
as
reshaping
duration.
Key
rate
duration
is
the

Laddered
maturities
A
maturity
pattern
within
a
portfolio
in
which
maturities
of
the
assets
in
the
portfolio
are
equally
spaced.
Over
time,
the
shortening
of
the

Land
contract
Contractual
arrangement
used
in
some
states
under
which
a
buyer
purchases
real
estate
from
a
seller
over
a
period
of
time,
usually
by
making
periodic
installment
payments.
Title
is
not
conveyed
to
the
buyer
until
the
final
payment
is
made.
Also
called
an
article
of
agreement.
Land
flip
A
colloquial
expression
used
by
some
lenders
and
real
estate
developers
to
describe
an
abuse
intended
to
overstate
the
purchase
price
of
real
estate
collateral.
Typically
a
land
flip
involves
a
sale
of
real
estate
at
an
inflated
price
that
is
not
an
arm’s
length
transaction.
An
example
of
this
kind
of
abuse
might
be
a
property
purchased
by
X
for
$50,000
and
one
year
later
sold
to
a
partnership
involving
X
for
$100,000.
Landlord’s
waiver
A
loan
document
used
in
a
number
of
different
situations.
Most
often
used
when
inventory
or
equipment
lenders
are
secured
by
collateral
located
in
premises
leased
by
the
borrower.
In
those
cases,
the
secured
lender
may
request
a
landlord’s
waiver
to
establish
the
lender’s
right
to
enter
the
premises
and
to
control
or
remove
the
collateral.
May
also
be
used
to
obtain
a
landlord’s
permission
and
waiver
of
rights
when
a
lender
takes
a
security
interest
in
leasehold
improvements
made
by
a
borrower/tenant.

LBO
See
leveraged
buyout.
Lease
A
contract
providing
for
the
use
of
property
in
which
one
party
(the
owner,
landlord,
or
lessor)
allows
another
party
(the
tenant
or
lessee)
to
use
the
property
in
exchange
for
value
given
to
the
lessor.
May
cover
either
real
or
personal
property.
Long-term,
noncancelable
leases,
called
capital
leases,
must
be
carried
on
the
lessee’s
balance
sheet
as
liabilities
under
GAAP.
When
they
are
recorded
on
the
lessee’s
balance
sheet,
they
are
said
to
be
capitalized.
Short-term,
cancelable
leases,
sometimes
called
operating
leases,
do
not
have
to
be
capitalized.
Leasehold
improvements
Things
such
as
walls,
air
conditioners,
and
shelves
that
are
added
to
leased
space.
Leasehold
mortgages
Collateral
interests
in
real
property
leased
by
the
borrower.
For
example,
a
borrower
may
own
a
building
located
on
leased
land.
In
those
cases,
a
lender
will
take
a
leasehold
mortgage
covering
the
borrower’s
interest
in
both
the
leased
land
and
the
building.
Lease
purchase
agreement
A
lease
that
includes
an
option
for
the
lessee
to
purchase
the
leased
property
at
a
time
and
under
terms
specified
in
the
lease.

Legal
risk
The
risk
to
earnings
or
capital
arising
from
unenforceable
contracts,
lawsuits,
adverse
judgments,
or
nonconformance
with
laws,
rules,
and
regulations.
One
of
six
risks
defined
by
the
Federal
Reserve.
The
Office
of
the
Comptroller
of
the
Currency
(OCC)
uses
a
slightly
narrower
definition
for
what
it
calls
compliance
risk.
Lender’s
loss
payable
clause
A
provision
in
a
hazard
insurance
contract
stipulating
that
in
the
event
of
a
loss,
proceeds
will
be
paid
to
a
secured
party.
Usually
used
when
the
insured
property
is
personal
property.
This
is
the
personal
property
version
of
the
standard
mortgagee
clause.
Unlike
a
more
common
loss
payable
clause,
the
lender’s
loss
payable
clause
is
actually
a
stronger,
much
broader
type
of
insurance
policy
stipulation.
Under
the
lender’s
loss
payable
clause,
the
secured
party
is
protected
against
any
act
or
neglect
of
the
insured
that
may
otherwise
invalidate
the
policy
for
the
owner.
(Some
states
use
a
different
form
that
also
provides
broader
coverage
than
the
simple
loss
payable
clause.)
Lender
liability
An
informal
term
referring
to
various
manifestations
of
actual
or
potential
legal
liability
arising
from
the
conduct
of
a
financial
institution
lender.
Generally,
lender
liability
arises
from
allegations
that
a
lender
has
violated
a
duty
(whether
implied
or
contractual)
of
good
faith
and
fair
dealing
owed
to
the
borrower
or
has
assumed
a
degree
of
control
over
the
borrower
resulting
in
the
creation
of
a
fiduciary
duty
owed
to
the
borrower
or
its
other
creditors
or
shareholders.
Letter
of
credit
An
obligation
issued
by
a
bank
on
behalf
of
a
bank
customer
to
a
third
party.
There
are
many
different
kinds
of
letters
of
credit.
The
two
most
common
are
commercial
letters
and
standby
letters.
A
commercial
or
trade
letter
of
credit
is
a
bank
promise
to
pay
the
third
party
for
the
purchase
of
goods
by
the
bank’s
customer.
A
standby
letter
of
credit
is
a
bank
promise
to
pay
the
third
party
in
the
event
of
some
defined
failure
by
the
bank’s
customer,
usually,
but
not
always,
a
failure
to
pay.
Standby
letters
of
credit
are
often
used
as
credit
enhancements
for
securities.
Letter
of
credit
right
A
right
to
payment
or
performance
under
a
letter
of
credit
whether
or
not
the
beneficiary
has
demanded
or
is
at
the
time
entitled
to
demand
payment
or
performance.
The
term
does
not
include
the
right
of
a
beneficiary
to
demand
payment
or
performance
under
a
letter
of
credit.

Level
factor
amortization
Perhaps
the
best
method
of
accounting
for
MBS
premiums
and
discounts
is
the
change
in
factor
or
level
factor
amortization
method.
Under
the
change
in
factor
method,
the
amount
of
monthly
premium
amortization
or
discount
accretion
is
calculated
to
be
proportionate
to
the
amount
of
the
monthly
principal
payments.
The
alternative
amortization
method
is
called
the
effective
interest
method.
Leverage
The
amount
of
the
owners’
or
stockholders’
money
relative
to
the
money
that
lenders,
suppliers
and
others
have
contributed
to
the
firm.
The
ratio
of
owners'
money
to
other
peoples'
money.
Leveraged
buyout
Corporate
acquisitions
in
which
the
acquiring
company
borrows
most
or
all
of
the
funds
needed
to
finance
the
purchase.
In
a
typical
leveraged
buyout,
the
buyer
intends
to
repay
the
finance
debt
from
funds
gained
from
either
the
sale
of
assets
owned
by
the
acquired
company
or
from
profits
earned
by
the
acquired
company.
The
high
level
of
debt
associated
with
almost
all
leveraged
buyouts
makes
them
relatively
high-risk
transactions.
Thus,
while
some
bank
financing
is
often
involved,
some
form
of
junior
debt
is
needed.
The
junior
debt
in
leveraged
buyout
may
come
from
a
lender
willing
to
take
a
subordinate
position.
This
type
of
financing
is
often
called
mezzanine
financing.
The
funds
needed
for
a
leveraged
buyout
may
also
be
raised
by
issuing
junk
bonds.
Leveraged
leases
A
form
of
lease
financing
in
which
the
lessor/owner
supplies
only
a
portion
of
the
cost
of
acquiring
the
leased
property
as
equity.
The
remaining
portion
of
the
purchase
price
of
the
leased
equipment
is
borrowed
from
long-term
lenders.

Liability
insurance
Insurance
that
protects
a
party
from
various
types
of
claims.
Typically
liability
insurance
protects
the
insured
from
losses
resulting
from
property
damage
claims
or
from
bodily
injury
claims.
Construction
lenders
usually
require
contractors
to
obtain
and
carry
liability
insurance
to
protect
against
claims
resulting
from
the
contractor’s
operations.
Liability
management
A
term
used
to
describe
the
general
banking
strategy
of
focusing
on
the
management
of
the
amount,
maturity,
and
cost
of
core
deposits
and
purchased
funds,
with
an
emphasis
on
the
latter.
Under
liability
management,
bankers
make
loans
and
loan
commitments
to
meet
market
conditions
without
concern
for
funding.
Liability
managers
increase
or
decrease
the
amount
of
funds
obtained
by
the
bank
as
necessary
to
provide
whatever
funding
is
needed
at
any
given
time.
Liability
sensitive
Describes
an
entity's
position
when
an
increase
in
interest
rates
will
hurt
the
entity
and
a
decrease
in
interest
rates
will
help
the
entity.
An
entity
is
liability
sensitive
when
the
impact
of
the
change
in
its
assets
is
smaller
than
the
impact
of
the
change
in
its
liabilities
after
a
change
in
prevailing
interest
rates.
This
occurs
when
either
the
timing
or
the
amount
of
the
rate
changes
for
assets
cause
interest
income
to
change
by
more
than
the
change
in
interest
expense.
The
impact
of
a
change
in
prevailing
interest
rates
may
be
measured
in
terms
of
the
change
in
the
value
of
assets
and
liabilities.
In
that
case,
a
liability
sensitive
entity’s
economic
value
of
equity
decreases
when
prevailing
rates
rise
or
increase
when
prevailing
rates
fall.
Alternatively,
the
impact
of
a
change
in
prevailing
rates
may
be
measured
in
terms
of
the
change
in
the
interest
income
and
expense
for
assets
and
liabilities.
In
that
case,
a
liability
sensitive
entity’s
earnings
or
net
income
decreases
when
prevailing
rates
rise
and
increases
when
prevailing
rates
fall.

Lien
An
interest
or
encumbrance
held
by
a
creditor
in
a
debtor's
real
or
personal
property
for
the
satisfaction
of
a
debt.
The
lien
may
arise
as
a
result
of
a
consensual
contract
between
the
debtor
and
the
creditor
such
as
a
security
agreement
or
a
mortgage.
Alternatively,
liens
may
be
established
by
courts
or
by
statutes.
See
consensual
lien,
judicial
lien
and

Lien
search
The
process
or
the
result
of
investigations
into
the
outstanding
liens
in
a
pledgor’s
or
potential
pledgor’s
property.
The
lien
search
not
only
investigates
the
existence
of
all
liens
but
also
the
relative
priority
of
those
liens.
For
personal
property,
a
lien
search
may
be
obtained
in
most
states
by
submitting
a
standard
form,
called
a
UCC-4,
to
the
appropriate
filing
office.
Secured
lenders
often
conduct
preclosing
lien
searches
prior
to
loan
closings
and
postclosing
lien
searches
shortly
after
loan
closings.
Life
estate
deed
A
document
used
to
convey
title
in
real
estate
from
one
party
to
another
but
only
upon
the
death
of
the
grantor.
A
life
estate
allows
the
grantor
the
right
to
own
or
possess
real
estate
until
his
or

interest.
The
holder
of
a

corporation.
A
limited
liability
company
offers
shareholders
the
limitations
on
personal
liability
that
are
available
to
stockholders
in
C
or
S
corporations.
At
the
same
time,
limited
liability
companies
are
taxed
very
much
like
partnerships;
that
is,
the
income
is
allocated
to
the
stockholders
for
tax
purposes.
Generally,
limited
liability
companies
offer
owners
the
same
advantages
of
the
more
familiar
S
corporations
but
have
fewer
restrictions.
Limited
partnership
A
partnership
with
at
least
one
general
partner
and
at
least
one,
often
more,
limited
partner(s).
The
general
partner
has
unlimited
liability
for
the
debts
of
the
partnership,
but
the
limited
partners
are
only
liable
to
the
extent
of
their
investment
in
the
partnership.

Line
of
credit
A
type
of
credit
facility.
The
specific
meaning
of
the
term
varies
from
bank
to
bank.
Since
the
various
uses
often
cause
confusion,
two
definitions
are
presented
here.
In
this
book,
the
second
definition
is
used.
(1)
A
type
of
loan
that
permits
a
borrower
to
draw
funds,
up
to
a
specified
maximum,
for
a
defined
period
of
time.
Sometimes
called
a
nonrevolving
line
of
credit.
(2)
Any
loan
that
permits
the
borrower
to
borrow
funds
up
to
a
specified
maximum,
make
repayments
in
any
amount
at
any
time,
and
obtain
any
number
of
readvances
so
long
as
the
maximum
is
not
exceeded.
Sometimes
called
a
revolving
line
of
credit.
The
distinguishing
feature
of
a
line
of
credit
is
that
it
rebounds,
which
means
that
the
amount
borrowed
can
be
paid
down
and
reborrowed,
or
readvanced,
as
the
borrower's
needs
change.
Liquidity
Both
the
capacity
and
the
perceived
capacity
to
meet
all
obligations
whenever
due
and
to
take
advantage
of
business
opportunities
important
to
the
future
of
the
enterprise.
The
capacity
and
the
perceived
ability
to
meet
known
near-term
and
projected
long-term
funding
commitments
while
supporting
selective
business
expansion.
Liquidity
contingency
risk
The
risk
that
future
events
may
require
a
materially
larger
amount
of
liquidity
than
the
financial
institution
currently
requires.
One
of
the
three
primary
components
of
liquidity
risk
along
with
mismatch
liquidity
risk
and
market
liquidity
risk.
Also
called
prudential
liquidity
risk,
funding
risk
or
stand-by
liquidity
risk.
Contingency
risk
arises
from
two
closely
related
elements.
See
liquidity
franchise
risk
and
liquidity
option
risk.
Liquidity
franchise
risk
The
risk
arising
from
the
implied
obligation
of
a
bank
to
continue
making
new
loans
or
other
new
business
related
cash
flows
in
order
to
preserve
its
business
franchise
even
though
it
may
be
having
funding
difficulties.
One
of
two
types
of
liquidity
contingency
risk.
Also
called
liquidity-implied
option
risk.

Liquidity
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business
One
of
the
three
main
types
of
liquidity-need
environments.
An
institution's
"going
concern"
need
for
liquidity.
Funding
required
for
the
normal
ebb
and
flow
of
cash
in
the
course
of
conducting
bank
business.
Includes
seasonal
funding
fluctuations.
See
bank-specific
liquidity
risk
and
systemic
liquidity
risk.
Liquidity
mismatch
or
liquidity
mismatch
risk
The
expected
amount
of
liquidity
risk
based
on
the
mismatch
between
contractual
amounts
and
dates
for
inflows
and
outflows.
Also
called
funding
gap,
liquidity
gap,
or
term
liquidity
risk.
One
of
the
three
primary
components
of
liquidity
risk
along
with
contingency
risk
and
market
liquidity
risk.
Liquidity
option
risk
The
risk
that
actual
cash
flows
will
occur
on
dates
or
in
amounts
different
from
the
contractual
maturity
dates
and
amounts.
Put
option
risk
includes
the
rights
of
saving,
checking,
and
money
market
depositors
to
withdraw
funds.
It
also
includes
the
right
of
certificate
of
deposit
(CD)
holders
to
make
early
withdrawals.
Call
option
risk
includes
the
rights
of
line
of
credit
borrowers
to
draw
down
on
their
committed
lines
of
credit.

liquidity
contingency
risk.

Liquidity
preference
(1)
A
desire
among
some
holders
of
financial
instruments
to
keep
some
or
all
of
their
funds
in
liquid
instruments,
that
is,
instruments
that
either
mature
in
a
short
period
of
time
or
that
can
be
readily
sold
with
small
risk
of
loss.
(2)
A
theory
that
attempts
to
explain
the
shape
of
yield
curves.
Under
the
liquidity
preference
hypothesis,
the
shape
of
yield
curves
is
determined
by
the
collective
expectations
of
investors
(the
expectations
hypothesis
and
implied
forward
rates)
but
with
an
upward
bias
at
least
for
short-
term
rates
caused
by
investors'
preferences
for
liquidity.
Liquidity
premium
(1)
The
portion
of
a
security's
yield
that
is
attributable
to
investors'
desire
to
hold
liquidity.
(2)
The
difference
or
spread
paid
for
liquidity.
Liquidity
reserves
The
amount
of
unused
capacity
to
meet
unexpected
reductions
in
funding
or
unexpected
new
funding
requirements
in
the
future.
For
much
of
the
twentieth
century,
liquidity
reserves
were
defined
as
primary
reserves
(cash
and
deposits
due
from
banks)
and
secondary
reserves
(short-term,
marketable
investment
securities).
However,
the
term
is
used
more
broadly
today.
Liquidity
risk
(1)
For
a
financial
institution,
the
risk
that
not
enough
cash
will
be
generated
from
either
assets
or
liabilities
to
meet
cash
requirements.
For
a
bank,
cash
requirements
are
primarily
made
up
of
deposit
withdrawals
or
contractual
loan
fundings.
One
of
six
risks
defined
by
the
Federal
Reserve
and
one
of
nine
risks
defined
by
the
Office
of
the
Comptroller
of
the
Currency
(OCC).
The
OCC
defines
liquidity
risk
as
the
risk
to
earnings
and
capital
arising
from
a
bank’s
inability
to
meet
its
obligations
when
they
become
due,
without
incurring
unacceptable
losses.
The
Federal
Reserve
uses
a
broad
definition
of
liquidity
risk
as
the
potential
that
an
institution
(a)
will
be
unable
to
meet
its
obligations
as
they
come
due
because
of
an
inability
to
liquidate
assets
or
obtain
adequate
funding
(referred
to
as
"funding
liquidity
risk")
or
(b)
cannot
easily
unwind
or
offset
specific
exposures
without
significantly
lowering
market
prices
because
of
inadequate
market
depth
or
market
disruptions
("market
liquidity
risk").
(2)
For
a
security,
the
risk
that
not
enough
interested
buyers
will
be
available
to
permit
a
sale
at
or
near
the
currently
prevailing
market
price.

Load
A
sales
charge
paid
by
an
investor
in
some
mutual
fund
shares
or
annuities.
The
sales
charge
may
be
a
front-end
charge,
a
back-end
charge,
or
a
12b-1
charge.
Also,
an
expression
used
to
describe
a
mutual
fund
that
imposes
sales
charges
on
investors.
The
opposite
of
a
no
load
mutual
fund.
See

Loan
application
register
(LAR)
A
document
required
by
the
Home
Mortgage
Discolure
Act
(HMDA)
to
gather
information
indicative
of
possible
discrimiantion.
Lending
institituions
are
required
to
collect
information
on
the
sex,
race
and
ethnicity
of
loan
applicants.
At
the
end
of
each
calendar
year,
the
lender
must
provide
the
loan
application
register
to
its
primary
regulator
no
later
than
March
1
of
the
following
year.
Once
the
information
is
analyzed
and
returned
in
the
form
of
a
disclosure
statement,
the
lender
must
make
the
information
available
to
the
public
at
its
home
office
and,
if
requested,
at
any

location.
Loan
participation
An
arrangement
in
which
two
or
more
lenders
share
in
a
loan
to
one
borrower.
Loan-to-value
(LTV)
ratio
The
name
used
to
refer
to
a
credit
analysis
ratio
that
measures
collateral
coverage.
To
calculate
the
LTV
ratio,
the
total
amount
of
the
borrower's
obligations
to
the
bank
is
divided
by
the
total
calculated
value
for
the
collateral.
For
example,
if
the
total
collateral
value
is
estimated
to
be
$1,000,000
and
the
total
amount
of
the
borrower's
obligations
to
the
bank
is
$800,000,
then
the
LTV
ratio
is
0.80
or
80percent.

Lockbox
(1)
A
cash
management
arrangement
designed
to
reduce
delays
in
depositing
funds
into
the
payee’s
bank
accounts.
A

office
box
that
is
established
by
a
bank
to
receive
checks
for
its
cash

Lockboxes
are
utilized
to
accelerate
deposits
to
the
bank
by
eliminating
internal
processing
by
the
payee
organization.
The
bank
need
not
maintain
a
separate
post
office
box

London
Interbank
Bid
Rate
(LIBID)
The
rate

to
acquire
funds
in
the
international
interbank

London
Interbank
Offered
Rate
(LIBOR)
The
rate
the

quality
banks
pay
for
Eurodollar
deposits.
There
is
a
different
LIBOR
for
each
deposit
maturity.
LIBOR
is
commonly
used
as
an
index
that
represents
short-term

Long
The
position
of
an
investor
who
owns,
or
commits
to
buy,
a
security
in
either
the
cash
or
futures
markets.
For
example,
the
purchase
of
an
interest
rate
future
is
a
commitment
to
take
delivery
of
securities
at
an
agreed-on
price
on
some
future
date.
This
is
called
a
long
futures
position.
Owning
an
investment
security
is
a
long
cash
position.
Long
bond
The
term
used
to
describe
the
most
recent
30-year
bond
issue.
Once
the
Treasury
sells
a
new
30-year
bond
issue,
that
issue
remains
the
long
bond
until
the
Treasury
sells
a
subsequent
issue.
Long
coupon
Sometimes
bonds
are
issued
with
a
bond
date
of
greater
than
six
months
from
the
issue
date.
Coupons
after
the
initial,
long
coupon
are
every
six
months.
A
long
coupon
reduces
the
effective
yield-to-maturity
by
reducing
the
income
that
can
be
earned
from
reinvestment
of
the

Management
letter
A
document
prepared
by
a
firm’s
auditors
in
conjunction
with
its
annual
audit.
Management
statements
Term
used
to
describe
financial
reports
prepared
by
the
borrower
with
no
assistance
from
independent,
outside
parties.
Mandatory
convertible
securities
Types
of
convertible
bonds
that
have
required
conversion
or
redemption
features.
One
type
of
mandatory
convertible
requires
the
holder
to
exchange
the
bonds
for
common
stock
at
maturity.
Often
used
by
banks
seeking
to
meet
regulatory
capital
requirements
without
issuing
common
stock
until
a
later
date.
Often
called
equity-linked
securities.
These
securities
provide
investors
with
higher
yields
to
compensate
holders
for
the
mandatory
conversion
structure.
They
also
typically
have
caps
on
the
amount
of
upside
potential
that
the
security
can
achieve.
For
moderate
stock
increases,
they
will
outperform
the
common
stock
due
to
the
yield
advantage,
but
the
cap
on
the
upside
means
that
they
lag
stock
performance
for
high
stock
returns.
Margin,
gross
margin,
net
margin,
security
margin,
variation
margin
(1)
An
amount
of
cash
or
collateral
that
a
buyer
or
borrower
must
provide
in
excess
of
value
owed
to
that
buyer
or
borrower
by
a
seller,
lender
or
depositor.
Ensures
performance
by
the
buyer
or
borrower.
Initial
margin
is
posted
at
inception.
Variation
margin
is
the
amount
of
any
additional
margin
needed
to
correct
deficiencies
in
the
currently
posted
margin.
(2)
The
amount
by
which
the
coupon
rate
for
a
floating-
or
variable-
rate
financial
instrument
differs
from
the
defined
index
for
that
coupon
rate.
For
example,
if
a
floating-rate
note
requires
that
the
coupon
rate
be
set
at
250
basis
points
above
30-day
LIBOR,
the
gross
margin
is
250
basis
points.
Can
also
be
the
amount
added
to,
or
subtracted
from,
the
index
in
determining
the
instrument's
fully
indexed
rate.
Investors
in
adjustable
rate
mortgage-backed
securities
(MBSs)
receive
a
coupon
rate
that
is
lower
than
the
fully
indexed
rate
because
the
cost
of
servicing,
the
servicing
spread,
is
deducted.
The
gross
spread
minus
the
servicing
spread
is
called
the
net
margin
or
the
security
margin.
See
index
and
servicing.
(3)
In
a
firm’s
profit
and
loss
statement,
margin
is
the
difference
between
sales
price
and
the
cost
of
goods
sold.
It
may
be
expressed
as
a
dollar
quantity
or
as
a
percentage
of
the
cost
of
goods
sold.
Margin
loans
Loans
acquired
from
brokers
or
financial
institutions
for
the
purpose
of
acquiring
margin
stock.
Margin
stock
A
term
defined
by
the
Federal
Reserve
Board
of
Governors
in
Regulations
T
and
U.
Any
stock
listed
on
a
national
securities
exchange,
any
over-the-counter
security
approved
by
the
SEC
for
trading
in
the
national
market
system,
or
any
security
appearing
on
the
Board's
list
of
over-the-counter
margin
stock
and
most
mutual
funds.
There
are
certain
requirements
a
stock
must
meet
before
it
can
be
margined.
The
most
important
of
which
is
that
the
price
must
be
greater
than
five
dollars.
Marginal
rate
Marginal
return
The
incremental
rate
or
return
realized
by
making
just
one
change,
adding
a
single
additional
unit,
or
deleting
a
single
unit.
For
example,
if
one
more
new
loan
is
added
to
an
existing
portfolio,
and
the
yield
on
that
loan
is
10%,
the
marginal
yield
for
the
portfolio
is
10%.
Not
the
same
as
the
average.
Mark
to
market
The
process
of
restating
the
carrying
value
of
an
asset
or
liability
to
equal
its
current
market
value.
Under
FAS
115,
financial
instruments
held
in
trading
accounts
must
be
marked
to
market
by
increasing
income
to
reflect
unrealized
gains
or
by
decreasing
income
to
reflect
unrealized
losses.
Financial
instruments
categorized
as
available-for-sale
(AFS)
under
FAS
115
must
also
be
marked
to
market
but
receive
different
accounting
treatment.
Market
depth
A
term
used
to
describe
the
characteristic
of
a
secondary
market
for
a
financial
instrument
evidenced
by
more
than
a
minimal
amount
of
active
daily
trading.
One
of
the
requirements
for
readily
marketable
assets.
Market
liquidity
risk
The
potential
that
an
institution
cannot
easily
unwind
or
offset
specific
exposures,
such
as
investments
held
as
liquidity
reserves,
without
incurring
a
loss
because
of
inadequate
market
depth
or
market
disruptions.
One
of
the
three
primary
components
of
liquidity
risk
along
with
mismatch
liquidity
risk
and
liquidity
contingency
risk.
Market
maker
An
individual
or
entity
that
stands
ready
to
buy
or
sell
financial
instruments
at
all
times.
Market
makers
quote
both
a
bid
and
an
offer
price
to
the
market.
Market
makers
provide
liquidity
to
markets.
They
profit
from
the
spread
between
bid
and
offer
prices
as
well
as
from
changes
in
market
prices.
Market
makers
adjust
their
bid
or
offer
prices
depending
upon
positions
that
they
hold
and/or
upon
their
outlook
for
changes
in
prices.
Market
risk
One
of
six
risks
defined
by
the
Federal
Reserve.
The
risk
of
an
increase
or
decrease
in
the
market
value/price
of
a
financial
instrument.
Market
values
for
debt
instruments
are
affected
by
actual
and
anticipated
changes
in
prevailing
interest
rates.
Market
values
for
all
financial
instruments,
except
direct
obligations
of
the
U.S.
Treasury,
are
affected
by
either
actual
or
perceived
changes
in
credit
quality.
Market
risk
includes
reinvestment
risk
-
that
is,
the
risk
that
all
or
part
of
the
principal
may
be
received
when
interest
rates
are
lower
than
when
the
security
was
originally
purchased.
In
that
case,
the
principal
must
be
reinvested
at
a
lower
rate
than
that
originally
received.
Sometimes
called
market
value
risk.
Also
see
interest
rate
risk
and
price
risk.

Market
value
The
value
of
a
financial
instrument
based
upon
the
price
at
which
a
financial
instrument
is
purchased
or
sold
or
the
price
at
which
it
could
presumably
be
purchased
or
sold.
For
an
equity
instrument,
the
product
of
the
number
of
shares
times
the
market
price.
For
a
debt
instrument,
the
product
of
the
par
or
current
face
times
the
market
price.
Market
value
of
portfolio
equity
(MVPE)
The
difference
between
the
sum
of
the
present
values
of
all
cash
flows
from
assets
and
the
sum
of
the
present
values
of
all
cash
flows
from
liabilities.
In
other
words,
the
market
value
of
the
institution’s
capital
account.
Defined
by
the
Office
of
Thrift
Supervision
(OTS)
to
represent
the
difference
between
the
market
value
of
a
financial
institution’s
assets
and
liabilities
plus
or
minus
the
value
of
any
off-balancesheet
positions.
This
is
a
proxy
or
estimate
used
for
capital
when
the
sensitivity
of
capital
to
changes
in
prevailing
interest
rates
is
calculated.
As
used
by
thrift
institutions
and
the
OTS,
the
term
has
been
replaced
by
"net
portfolio
value"
or
NPV.
As
used
by
bankers
and
banking
regulators,
the
term
is
slowly
being
replaced
by
"economic
value
of
equity"
or
EVE.
See
net
economic
value
and
value
at

Market
value
simulation
The
process
of
generating
multiple
forecasts
for
future
interest
rate
scenarios
and
then
discounting
the
estimated
cash
flows
anticipated
under
those
rate
scenarios.
The
results
of
market
value
simulation
are
a
range
of
forecasted
market
values
of
equity
for
both
current
and
potential
rate
risk
exposures.
Comparisons
of
these
forecasted
MVPE
values
reveal
the
sensitivity
of
MVPE
to
changes
in
rates.
Marketable,
marketability
An
attribute
that
may
or
may
not
be
associated
with
a
security.
A
security
is
considered
to
be
marketable
if
it
is
readily
salable
to
buyers
in
an
active
secondary

As
defined
by
the
Office
of
the
Comptroller
of
the
Currency
(OCC)
(12
CFR
1),
marketable
means
that
the

Is
registered
under
the
Securities
Act
of
1933,15
USC
77a
et

from
registration
under
the
Securities
Act
of
1933,
15

(1)
Securities
A
written
contract
covering
all
future

to
repurchase/reverse
repurchase
agreements
and
establishing
each

Match
fund
or
matching
An
entity
is
said
to
match
fund
a
loan
or
investment
when
it
acquires
a
liability
in
equal
amount
for
the
same
maturity.
However
it
is
not
perfectly
match
funded
unless
all
of
the
interest
and
principal
cash
flows
and
any
prepayment
options
are
also
the
same
for
the
asset
as
they
are
for
the
liability.
Match
maturity
funds
transfer
pricing
(MMFTP)
A
funds
transfer
pricing
system
or
methodology
that
assigns
a
cost
of
funds
to
assets
and
a
credit
for
funds
to
liabilities
that
reflect
the
interest
rate
risk
-
especially
the
rate
risk
associated
with
the
time
remaining
to

-
in
those
assets
or
liabilities.

Matched
trade
A
trade
that
is
mirrored
by
an
equal
and
offsetting
trade
with
a
different
counterparty.
In
a
matched
trade,
the
interest
rate,
market,
and
price
risks
are
offset
but
not
the
credit
risk.
The
trading
entity
incurs
credit
risk
for
the
counterparties
on
each
side
of
the
trade.
Materialman's
lien
A
lien
against
real
property
created
under
state
laws
that
give
a
person
who
supplies
materials
used
to
repair
or
improve
real

the
right
to
place
a

if
that
person
is

principal
payment
on
a
debt
is
due
and
payable.

Maturity
transformation
The
term
economists
use
to
describe
the
activity
of
a
financial
intermediary
that
accepts
deposits
or
investments
of
one
term
(usually
short)
and
places
those
funds
with
a
debtor
in
another

Maximum
forward
rate
smoothing
An
alternative
yield
curve
smoothing
technique.
The
most
accurate
yield
curve
smoothing
method
for
forward
rates.
The
yield
curve
with
the
smoothest
possible
forward
rate
function,
consistent
with
observable
data,
is
closely
related
to
but
significantly
different
from
the
popular
cubic
spline
approach
to
the
smoothing
of
both
yields
and
discount
bond
prices.
The
yield
curve
which
produces
the
smoothest
possible
forward
rates
consistent
with
given
zero
coupon
bond
prices
has
a
quartic
forward
rate
function
which
spans
each
time
interval
between
observable
data
points.
This
contrasts
with
the
cubic
polynomial
that
is
used
to
fit
either
yields
or
discount
bond
prices
in
the
cubic
spline
approach.
This
method
produces
the
smoothest
possible
forward
rate
curve
(with
f’=0
at
the
longest
maturity)
that
causes
the
interpolated
yield
curve
to
be
totally
consistent
with
the
observable
data.

Medium-term
notes
(MTNs)
Debt
instruments
with
maturities
ranging
from
9
months
to
30
years
that
are
offered
on
a
continuous
basis.
Offered
on

Money
market
deposit
account
(MMDA)
A
bank
deposit
account
designed
to
pay
a
higher
rate
of
interest
to
depositors
than
might
otherwise
be
earned
in
checking
or
savings
accounts.
Money
market
deposit
accounts
do
not
have
specified
maturities.
Their
rates
are
administered
by
the
bank
although
they
are
influenced
by
prevailing
rates
for
money
market
instruments
traded
in
capital
markets.
Some
banks
index
the
rates
that
they
pay
on
MMDAs
to
rates
paid
for
traded
money
market
instruments
such
as
U.S.

Money
market
fund
A
form
of
mutual
fund
that
restricts
investments
to
relatively
safe,
relatively
short-term
instruments.
Typical
money
market
funds
may
invest
in
short-term
U.S.
government
obligations,
commercial
paper,
and
banker’s
acceptances.
Average
maturities
of
fund
assets
are
typically
14
to
28
days.
The
income,
less
costs,
is
paid
out
every
day
so
that
the
share
value
is
always
the
same.
However,
shareholders
are
not
protected
against
loss
from
the
fund's
investments.
Money
market
instrument
The
broadest
definition
of
a
money
market
instrument
is
a
short-term
debt
instrument
that
is
purchased
from
a
broker,
dealer,
or
bank.
Sometimes
the
term
"money
market"
is
used
more
restrictively
by
further
defining
short-term
to
mean
an
instrument
with
no
more
than
12
months
remaining
from
the
purchase
date
until
the
maturity
date.
(The
remaining
life
of
the
instrument
is
the
basis
for
the
definition
rather
than
the
its
original
term.)
Sometimes
money
market
is
used
more
restrictively
to
mean
only
those
instruments
that
have
active
secondary
markets.
Definitions
of
money
market
instruments
that
only
include
instruments
with
active
secondary
markets
exclude
non-negotiable
investments
such
as
most
bank
certificates
of

Money
market
rate
In
asset/liability
management,
the
phrase
money
market
rate
is
used
to
distinguish
a
rate
set
in
actively
traded
markets
from
a
rate
that
is
administratively
set
by
banks
or
other
financial
institutions.
Rates
on
short-term
U.S.
Treasury
notes
and
the
London
Interbank
Offered
Rate
(LIBOR)
are
the
most
common
money
market
rates.
However,
any
actively
traded,
short-term,
high-quality
instrument
might
be
considered
to
be
a
money
market
instrument.

Mortgage
(1)
noun
—
A
legal
instrument
that
creates
a
lien
upon
real
estate
for
the
purpose
of
securing
a
debt.
The
instrument
is
executed
by
a
lender
and
a
borrower
or
guarantor
as
collateral
for
the
payment
of
a
debt
that
creates
a
lien
on
real
estate
owned
by
the
borrower
or
guarantor.
The
borrower
or
guarantor
is
called
the
mortgagor
and
the
lender
is
called
the
mortgagee.
In
some
states,
a
different
legal
instrument
called
a
deed
of
trust
fulfills
a
similar
function
even
though
it
is
not
legally
the
same.
See
chattel
mortgage.
(2)
verb
—
The
action
of
granting
a
lien
to
pledge
real
property
as
security
for
the
repayment
of
a
debt.
Mortgage
bonds
A
common
type
of
secured
corporate
bond.
The
bond
indenture
for
mortgage
bonds,
along
with
associated
documents
executed
by
the
issuer,
provides
for
the
bondholders
to
have,
through
the
trustee,
an
interest
in
real
property
collateral.
For
example,
the
bonds
may
be
secured
by
a
mortgage
on
real
estate
used
by
the
company.
This
may
be
the
case
when
the
bond
proceeds
are
used
to
finance
the
construction
of
a
factory
or
plant.
(Many
pollution
control
and
utility
bonds
are
mortgage
bonds.)
It
is
important
to
understand
that
the
mortgage
is
not
the
sole,
or
even
the
primary,
backing
for
the
repayment
of
these
bonds.
These
debts
are
still
financial
obligations
that
the
firm
must
repay
even
if
the
value
of
the
collateral
falls.

Mortgage
loan
A
loan
secured
by
a
mortgage.
In
the
mortgage-backed

industry,
loans
secured
through
deeds
of
trust
are
also
referred
to
as

loans.
Mortgage
note
A
name
used
to
describe
a
promissory
note
that
is
secured
by
an
interest
in
real
property.
Mortgage
notes
generally,
but
not
always,
call
for
mostly
regular,
periodic
payments
of
principal
and
interest.
Mortgage
pass-through
The
simplest
and
oldest
type
of
MBS.
A
pass-through
is
a
security
that
provides
its
owners
with
a
pro
rata
claim
to
all
of
the
cash
flow
generated
from
a
pool
of
mortgage
loans.
Mortgage
REIT

Mortgage-backed
security
(MBS)
or
mortgage-backed
bond
Securities
composed
of,
or
collateralized
by,
loans
that
are
themselves
collateralized
by
liens
on
real
property.
MBSs
can
be
categorized
into
two
major
types.
Pass-through
pools
are
mortgage-backed
bonds
created
by
assembling
a
pool
of
similar
mortgage
loans
into
a
single
security.
Investors
in
a
pass-through
pool
receive
a
portion
of
every
interest
and
principal
payment
(less
serving
charges)
that
is
equivalent
to
the
investor’s
pro
rata
ownership
share
in
the
pool.
The
other
major
type
is
collateralized
mortgage
obligations
(CMOs),
usually
real
estate
mortgage
investment
conduits
(REMICs).
Investors
in
a
CMO
own
the
rights
to
receive
cash
flow
from
an
underlying
pool
of
mortgages
in
a
predetermined
order
based
on
priority.
CMO
securities
are
secured
by
pass-through
pools.
Both
types
of
MBSs
may
be
backed
by
either
liens
on
residential
or
commercial
properties;
however,
residential
mortgages
are
more
common.
Both
types
of
MBSs
may
be
issued
by
either
government
agencies
or
private
issuers;
however,
those
issued
by
government
agencies
are
more
common.

Mortgagee
A
secured
party
to
whom
insurance
proceeds
are
paid
as
stipulated
in
a
mortgagee
payee
clause
of
an
insurance
policy
obtained
by
a
debtor
and
covering
property
owned
by
a
debtor
and
pledged
to
the
secured
party.
Generally
applies
to
real
property.
Mortgagee
clause
A
provision
in
a
hazard
insurance
contract
stipulating
that
in
the
event
of
a
loss,
proceeds
will
be
paid
to
a
secured
party.
Usually
used
when
the
insured
property
is
real
property.
Includes
personal
property
that
is
insured
as
contents
of
the
insured
real
property.
The
term
mortgagee
clause
may
be
used
to
refer
to
all
such
insurance
policy
stipulations.
However
mortgagee
clauses
are
technically
not
as
broad
as
a
similar
insurance
policy
stipulation
called
a
standard
mortgagee
clause.
See

clause.
Mortgagee
waiver
A
document
obtained
by
some
secured
lenders
with
a
collateral
interest
in
property
covered
or
potentially
covered
by
a
mortgage
granted
to
a
different
lender.
For
example,
if
Bank
B
is
taking
a
security
interest
in
large
equipment
that
might
be
deemed
to
be
fixtures
covered

a
mortgage
held
by
Bank
A,
Bank
B
may
request
a
mortgagee
waiver
from
Bank
A.
May
also
be
used
when
a
tenant
is
granting
its
lender
a
security
interest
in
property
that
might
be

National
Association
of
Securities

(NASD)
An
association
of

The
association
supervises
and
regulates
the

and
the
conduct
of
its
member
organizations
and
the

The

Exchange
Act
of
1934.
Even
though
it

National
Flood
Insurance
Reform
Act
A
Federal
law
that
establishes
requirements
for
flood
insurance.
Under
the
National
Flood
Insurance
Reform
Act
of
1994,
lenders
taking
an
interest
in
real
property
are
required
to
complete
a
standard
flood
hazard
determination
form
developed
by
the
Federal
Emergency
Management
Agency
(FEMA).
Flood
hazard
forms
must
be
retained
in
the
lender’s
records.
If
the
form
indicates
that
the
property
is
in
a
designated
flood
hazard
zone,
the
lender
is
required
to
have
flood
insurance
protection.
Lenders
may
also
have
notice
requirement
obligations
for
collateral
located
in
flood
hazard
zones.
Natural
hedges
Balance
sheet
hedge
activity
done
by
altering
asset
and/or
liability
repricing
characteristics
or
volumes
to
reduce
the
entity's
interest
rate
risk
exposure
without
purchasing
derivative
hedge
instruments
such
as
interest
rate
swaps
or
futures.
The
opposite
of
natural
hedging
is
capital
markets
or
derivatives
hedging.
Note
that
some
bankers
use
the
term
"natural
hedges"
more
narrowly
than
others.
As
narrowly
defined,
a
natural
hedge
is
one
in
which
the
rate
risk
in
one
piece
of
customer
business
is
offset
by
the
rate
risk
in
another
piece
of
customer
business.
Thus
a
hedge
involving
the
investment
portfolio
is
not
a
natural
hedge
under
the
most
narrow
definition
of
the
term.

Negative
amortization
The
increase
in
a
loan
balance
resulting
from
a
situation
in
which
the
payments
due
from
the
borrower
are
not
sufficient
to
cover
the
full
amount
of
the
interest
due.
The
amount
of
interest
due
that
is
not
covered
by
the
amount
of
the
payment
is
added
to
the
unpaid
principal
balance
of
the
loan.
Negative
amortization
typically
occurs
during
periods
of
high
interest
rates
for
loans
with
floating
interest
rates
but
fixed
monthly
payments.
Negative
convexity
A
phrase
use
to
describe
a
particular
type
of
instability
in
the
duration
of
an
instrument.
Negative
convexity
means
that
as
yields
rise,
duration
rises
and
as
yields
fall,
duration
falls.
Graphically,
this
is
seen
as
a
price/yield
curve
for
which
the
price
at
very
low
and
very
high
yields
is
less
than
the
price
indicated
by
a
straight,
tangent
line.
For
an
instrument
with
negative
convexity,
duration
understates
the
interest
rate
sensitivity.
If
convexity
is
low,
that
is,
if
the
price/yield
relationship
is
close
to
a
straight
line,
duration
is
stable.
If
convexity
is
high,
duration
is
unstable.
The
greater
an
instrument's
convexity,
the
less
accurate
duration
will
be.
Callable
bonds,
loans,
and
mortgage-backed
bonds
typically
have
negative
convexity.

Negative
covenant
A
provision
in
the
lender's
documents
that
prohibits
the
borrower
from
doing
something
in
the
future.
For
example,
a
provision
prohibiting
the
borrower
from
acquiring
additional
debt
during
the
term
of
the
loan.
Negative
duration
(1)
The
name
for
a
particular
relationship
between
changes
in
the
price
of
a
debt
security
and
changes
in
prevailing
interest
rates.
When
a
security
has
negative
duration,
its
price
decreases
in
response
to
a
decrease
in
prevailing
market
rates.
Very
few
securities
have
negative
duration.
Note
that
the
term
"duration,"
as
used
in
this
definition,
refers
to
modified
duration.
See
convexity,
duration
and
positive
duration.
(2)
For
a
financial
institution,
a
situation
in
which
the
total
duration
of
its
assets
is
shorter
than
the
total
duration
of
its
liabilities.
In
such
cases,
the
duration
of
equity
is
negative.
In
other
words,
an
entity
with
short-term
assets
funded
by
long-term
liabilities
will
have
a
negative
duration
of
equity.
A
financial
institution
that
has
a
negative
duration
of
equity
may
also
be
described
as
having
a
positive
gap
or
as
being
asset
sensitive.
The
theoretical
equity
value,
but
not
necessarily
the
stock
price,
of
a
financial
institution
with
a
negative
duration
of
equity
will
decrease
if
rates
decline
and
increase
if
rates
rise.
Note
that
the
term
"duration,"
as
used
in
this
definition,
refers
to
modified
duration.
See
convexity,
effective
duration,
Macaulay
duration

Negative
gap
A
term
referring
to
a
liability-sensitive
condition.
A
mismatch
in
which
interest-sensitive
liabilities
exceed
interest-sensitive
assets.
Negative
pledge
A
document
or
a
provision
in
a
document
in
which
a
borrower
agrees
not
to
give
any
creditor
a
security
interest
in
identified
property
owned
by

Net
asset
value
(NAV)
A
mutual
fund’s
share
value.
It
is
calculated
by
subtracting
total
liabilities
from
total
assets
to
determine
net
worth
or
equity.
The
equity
value
is
then
divided
by
the
number
of
outstanding
shares.
The
NAV
is
calculated
once
each
day
at
the
close
of
business.
Net
economic
value
Term
favored
by
the
Federal
Banking
regulators
in
lieu
of
market

of
portfolio
equity.
The
difference
between
the

flows
from
assets
and
the
sum
of
the
present
values
of
all
cash
flows
from
liabilities.
This
is
a
proxy
or
estimated
value
used
for
capital
when
the
sensitivity
of
capital
to

rates
is
calculated.

Net
interest
margin
The
amount
of
interest
income
minus
interest
expense,
usually
expressed
as
a
percentage.
The
net
interest
margin
percentage
is
calculated
by
dividing
interest
income
less
interest
expense
by
average
earning
assets.
If
interest
income
includes
tax-free
income,
that
income
should
be
"grossed
up"
to
its
taxable
equivalent
before
calculating
the
percentage.
(To
gross
up
tax-free
income
to
its
taxable
equivalent,
divide
the
income
by
one
minus
the
marginal
income
tax
rate.)
The
net
interest
margin
expressed
as
a
percentage
of
earning
assets
is
often
confused
with
the
net
spread.
The
spread
is
the
difference
between
the
average
rate
earned
on
assets
minus
the
average
rate
paid
on
liabilities.
That
spread
would
only
equal
the
net
interest
margin
percentage
if
the
dollar
amount
of
earning
assets
equaled
the
dollar
amount
of
interest-bearing
liabilities.
Net

noninterest
income
offset
noninterest

No-load
An
expression
used
to
describe
a
mutual
fund
that
does
not
impose
any
sales
charges
on
investors.
The
term

used
to
describe
a
fund
without
either
a
front-end

but
which
may
nevertheless
have

Nonappropriation
clause
A
provision
in
some
municipal
leases.
The
clause
provides
that
the
lease
terminates
without
penalty
to
the
lessee
in
the
event
that
the
municipal
lessee
fails
to
appropriate
sufficient
funds
to
make
required
lease
payments
during
the
ensuing
annual
or
biannual
budget
period.
Usually,
this
clause
is
only
used
in
states
where
legal
restrictions
apply
to
the
quantity
of
or
to
the
approval
process
required
for
municipal
debt.
The
nonappropriation
clause
is
intended
to
avoid
characterization
of
the
lease
as
debt
subject
to
such
restrictions.
This
clause
is
almost
always
used
in
conjunction
with
a
nonsubstitution
clause.

personnel,
occupancy,
equipment,
and
professional
services.
Noninterest
income
For
a
financial
institution,
operating
income
from
sources
other
than
interest
income.
The
main
components
of
noninterest
income
are
fees
such
as
deposit
service
charges,
funds
transfer
fees,
trust
fees,
brokerage
fees,
etc.
Non-notification
Receivable
lending
in
which
the
borrower's
account
debtors
are
not
notified
of
the
bank's
lien.
(The
bank
may
use
non-notification
lending
but
still
have
a
provision
in
the
loan
document
that
allows
the
bank
to
switch
to
notification-based
financing
in
the
event
of
a
default.)
Under
non-notification
financing
arrangements,
payments
may
be
sent
directly
to
the
bank
by
the
account
debtors.
Nonpossessory
agricultural
lien
An
interest
other
than
a
security
interest
in
farm
products
that
secures
payment
or
performance
of
an
obligation
for
goods
or
services
furnished
in
connection
with
a
debtor’s
farming
operation.
Arises
primarily
through
the
furnishing
of
goods
and
services
or
leased
property
that
are
connected
with
a
debtor’s
farming
operation.
Nonsubstitution
clause
A
provision
in
some
municipal
leases.
This
lease
provision
stipulates
that
if
the
municipal
lessee
terminates
the
lease
under
a
nonappropriation
clause,
the
lessee
will
not
use
any
other
property
performing
a
similar
function
to
that
performed
by
the
property
covered
by
the
lease
for
the
period
of
time
covered
by
the
lease.
The
nonsubstitution
clause
is
intended
to
be
a
deterrent
to
termination
of
the
lease
contract
under
a
nonappropriation
clause.
Notice
of
adverse
action
In
many
cases,
lenders
are
required
by
law
to
provide
applicants
with
timely
notice
of
adverse
action,
such
as
denial
of
credit
applications.
This
requirement
applies
to
some
loans
covered
by
the
Equal
Credit
Opportunity
Act
and
to
some
loans
covered
by
the
Women’s
Business
Ownership
Act.
Notification
Receivable
lending
with
the
requirement
that
the
borrower's
account
debtors
must
be
notified
of
the
bank's
lien.
The
payments
on
the
accounts
are
then
usually
sent
directly
to
the
lender
by
the
account
debtors.
Sometimes
called
notification
plan.
Notional
amount
The
principal
amount
or
face
value
of
a
derivative.
Defined
by
the
Financial
Accounting
Standards
Board
(FASB)
in
FAS
133
as
the
number
of
currency
units,
shares,
bushels,
pounds
or
other
units
specified
in
a
derivatives
contract.
The
notional
amount
is
used
to
calculate
the
payments
that
are
exchanged
by
the
counterparties
in
the
transaction.
Market
participants
refer
to
notional
principal
because,
unlike
bonds
or
other
conventional
credit
instruments,
these
types
of
derivatives
do
not
involve
an
exchange
of
principal.
Rather,
the
parties
state
the
principal
amount
only
as
a
basis
for
calculating
the
sizes
of
the
interest
related
payments
that
they
exchange.
In
this
application,
principal
is
only
a
reference
point
or
idea
-
hence
the
term.
Also
called
the
notional
principal
balance.

Operational
efficiency
A
term
used
to
describe
the
characteristic
of
a
secondary
market
for
a
financial
instrument
evidenced
by
low
transaction
costs
and
smooth
execution
of
trades.
The
spread
between
bid
and
offered
prices,
brokerage
commissions,
and
taxes
are
the
three

Operations
risk
Operational
risk
The
risk
to
the
bank
that
errors
made
in
the
course
of
conducting
its
business
will
result
in
losses.
The
Federal
Reserve
calls
this
operational
risk
and
states
in
its
definition
that
operational
risk
arises
from
the
potential
that
inadequate
information
systems,
operational
problems,
breaches
in
internal
controls,
fraud,
or
unforeseen
catastrophes
will
result
in
unexpected
losses.
The
Office
of
the
Comptroller
of
the
Currency
calls
this
transaction
risk
and
defines
it
as
the
risk
to
earnings
or
capital
from
problems
with
service
or
product
delivery.
Operations
risk

has
two
parts.
One
describes
the
scope
of
the
accountant’s
work
in
the
preparation
and
testing,
if
any,
related
to
the
preparation
of
the
financial
reports
covered
by
the

the
accountant’s
opinion
regarding
the
fairness,
accuracy,
and
conformity
with
GAAP
of
the
financial

term.
In
loans,
the
most
common
form
of
option
risk
arises
from
a
borrower’s
right
to
prepay.
In
securities,
the
most
common
form
of
option
risk
arises
from
an
issuer’s
right
to
call
the
security.

Option-adjusted
duration
A
duration
measure
that
does
allow
for
changes
in
cash
flows
as
yields
change
A
variation
of
effective
or
empirical
duration.
Option
adjusted
duration
incorporates
the
expected
duration-shortening
effect
of
an
issuer's
embedded
call
provision.
It
is
also
called

Option-adjusted
spread
(OAS)
(1)
A
measurement
of
the
return
provided
to
an
investor
from
a
financial
instrument
that
is
either
an
option
or
that
includes
an
option.
The
option-adjusted
spread
calculations
break
up
a
security
into
separate
cash
flows.
Each
of
those
cash
flows
is
discounted
at
a
unique
discount
rate
appropriate
for
its
maturity.
The
discount
rates
are
obtained
from
a
benchmark
yield
curve.
The
benchmark
yield
curve
is
simply
the
currently
available
(spot)
yields
for
risk-free
investments
of
various
maturities.
Since
U.S.
Treasury
obligations
are
not
considered
to
have
any
credit
risk,
Treasury
rates
are
used.
OAS
is
not
quoted
as
a
yield.
Instead,
it
is
quoted
as
a
difference,
or
spread,
in
basis
points.

This
methodology
is
also
used
by
high-end
commercial

Option
risk
The
risk
that
a
change
in
prevailing
interest
rates
will
lead
to
an
adverse
impact
on
earnings
or
capital
caused
by
changes
in
the
timing
of
cash
flows
from
investments.
Cash
flows
may
be
received
earlier
than

as
a
result
of
the
exercise
of

in
financial

One
of
the
four
primary
components
of

usually
arises
when
a

to
exercise
the
option.

Pair-off
A
security
purchase
transaction
that
is
closed
out
or
sold
on
or
before
the
settlement
or
expiration
date.
In
a
pair-off,
the
investor
commits
to
purchase
a
security.
Then,
prior
to
the
predetermined
settlement
date,
the
investor
offsets
that
purchase
with
a
sale
of
the
same
security
that
is
arranged
to
settle
on
or
before
the
settlement
date
for
the
purchase.
Instead
of
paying
for
the
purchased
security
on
the
settlement
date,
the
investor
need
only
pay
or
receive
the
difference
between
the
purchase
and
sale
prices.
Pair-offs
are
price
speculations
that
are
considered
trading
activities
and
may

Partial
duration
A
duration
measure
calculated
by
changing
one
variable
while
all
other
variable
are
held
constant.
The
most
common
example
Is
key
rate
duration
where
all
variables
are
held
constant
except
the
yield
for
a
specific
maturity
point
on
the
yield
curve.
Another
application
of
partial
duration
is
the
calculation
of
option-adjusted
duration
by
changing
a
variable
such
the
OAS
while
holding
all
other
variables
constant.
Partial
release
A
document
or
a
process
in
which
a
secured
party
gives
up
its
collateral
interest
in
a
portion
of
the
property
of
the
debtor
that
is
pledged
to
secure
a
loan.
For
example,
if
a
real
estate
developer
has
pledged
10
lots
as
collateral
for
a
loan,
a
partial
release
may
be
used
for
each
lot
as
it
is
sold.
For
personal
property
collateral,
a
partial
release
may
be
entered
into
the
public
record
by
using
a
standard
form
called
a
UCC-3.
Participation
An
agreement
between
lenders
to
share
a
commitment
to
extend
funds
(if
any),
the
extension
of
funds,
and
the
credit
risk
for
one
or
more
credit
facilities
to
a
borrower.
Almost
always
evidenced
by
a

agreement.
Partnership
See
general
partnership
and
limited

Pass-through
The
original
type
of
MBS
structure.
In
a
pass-through,
investors
own
a
pro
rata
claim
to
the
cash
flows
from
the
pool
of
underlying
mortgages.
Each
investor’s
pro
rata
share
of
interest
and
principal
is
remitted
to
the
investor,
"passed
through,"
by
an
agent.
Pass-through
rate
The
net
amount
of
interest
paid
to
investors
owning
mortgage-backed
securities
after
all
servicing
and
guarantee
fees
are
deducted.
Path-dependent
options
Options
whose
exercise
is
influenced
by
the
historical
trend
in
interest
rates
in
addition
to
the
current
level
of
interest
rates.
The
exercise
of
a
path
dependent
option
is
influenced
by
whether
or
not
it
is
in
the
money
as
well
as
by
how
many
times
that
option
has
previously
been
that
deep
in
the
money.
Loan
prepayments
are
path
dependent.
For
example,
if
interest
rates
fall
to
8
percent,
a
borrower
with
an
11
percent
loan
is
less
likely
to
prepay
his
loan
than
another
borrower
if
rates
have
fallen
to
8
percent
and
returned
to
11
percent
several
times
since
the
first
borrower
obtained
his
loan
but
only
fallen
to
8
percent
once
since
the
second
borrower
obtained
his
loan.
Patriot
Act
Short
name
for
the
"Uniting

Providing
Appropriate
Tools
Required
to
Intercept
and
Obstruct
Terrorism
Act
of
2001"
("USA
PATRIOT
Act").
The
Patriot
Act
was
signed
by
President
Bush
on
October
26,
2001.
This
act
contains
a
number
of
significant
regulatory
requirements
for
banks.
Section
314(b)
permits
financial
institutions,
upon
providing
notice
to
the
United
States
Department
of
the
Treasury,
to
share
information
with
one
another
in
order
to
identify
and
report
to
the
federal
government
activities
that
may
involve
money
laundering
or
terrorist
activity.
Section
326
of
the
USA
PATRIOT
Act
requires
that
financial
institutions
implement
reasonable
procedures
to
(1)
verify
the
identity
of
any
person
opening
an
account;
(2)
maintain
records
of
the
information
used
to
verify
the
person's
identity;
and
(3)
determine
whether
the
person
appears
on
any
list
of
known
or
suspected
terrorists
or
terrorist
organizations.
Additional
provisions
prohibit
banks
from
having
accounts
with
shell
banks,
address
availability
of
bank
records,
and
change
and
clarify
suspicious
activity
report
requirements.
Payable-through-draft
(PTD)
A
form
of
check
that
is
written
on
an
organization
other
than
a
bank
but
is
payable
through
banks.
Credit
union
"checks"
are
actually
PTDs.
PTDs
are
recognized
as
disbursements
after
they
clear,
not
when
they
are
written.
A
PTD
functions
the
same
as
a
warrant.
Payee
processing
float
Time
between
when
a
payment
is
received
and
when
the
funds
are
deposited.
When
employees
hold
their
paychecks
over
a
weekend
and
when
vendors
process
receipts
only
once
a
week,
the
payor
benefits
from
the
extra
time
its
investments
earn
interest.
These
beneficial
payee
processing
delays
are
limited
to
payments
by
check.
Electronic
payments
(wire
transfers
and
ACH
credits)
produce
no
processing
delay
at
all.
Paying

Pension
Benefit
Guaranty
Corporation
(PBGC)
A
U.S.
Government
agency
that
was
created
to
insure

PBGC
has
statutory
authority
to

to
30%
of
the
net
assets
of
a
firm
that
sponsors
a
pension
plan
when
an
underfunded
plan
is
terminated.
Such
a
PBGC
claim
is
granted
the
same
priority
over
the
claims
of
other
creditors
as
a

Perfected
security

A

Perfection
The
name
for
a
procedure
established
by
Article
9
of
the
Uniform
Commercial
Code.
Creditors
must
comply
with
this
procedure
in
order
to
establish
the
priority
of
their
security
interest
in
personal
property
relative
to
the
priority
of
security
interests
in
the
same
property
that
may
be
held
by
other
creditors.
(It
may
be
used
when
an
interest
in
collateral
is
provided
by
the
debtor
or
by
a
guarantor
or
other
third
party.)
Perfection
does
not
normally
constitute
the
actual
agreement
between
the
secured
party
and
the
debtor.
By
itself,
perfection
does
not
create
a
security
interest
and
must
therefore
be
supported
by
a
separate
security
agreement
or
pledge
agreement.
There
are
several
different
procedures
that
can
be
used
to
achieve
perfection
of
a
security
interest
in
a
debtor’s
personal
property.
The
most
common
method
is
perfection
by
filing
a
financing
statement.
See
financing
statements
and
security
agreement.
Performance
bond
A
type
of
insurance
purchased
by
a
builder
that
protects
both
the
bank
and
the
owner
by
providing
that
the
insurance
company
will
be
responsible
for
completing
construction
if
the

fails
to
do
so.
Periodic
cap
The
maximum
amount
by
which
an
adjustable-rate
security’s
coupon
rate
can
change
in
any
given
period
of
time.
Also
called
reset
cap.
For
most
ARMs
and
floaters,
the
maximum
periodic
or
reset
change
is
defined

Permanent
working
capital
An
informal
phrase
used
to
describe
the
amount
of
short-term
liabilities
needed
to
offset
a
continuous

shortfall.
Also
used
as
a
name
for
a
borrower's
need
for
year-round
working
capital
financing.
This
type
of
financing
is
usually
needed
by
rapidly
growing
and/or
undercapitalized
firms
and
is
usually
provided
by
asset-based
lenders.

Phase
I
audit
The
most
common
form
of
environmental
liability
risk
assessment.
A
phase
I
audit
consists
of
a
thorough
review
of
the
past
and
present
ownership
of
the
property
as
well
as
the
past
and
present
uses
of
the
property.
These
reviews
include
examinations
of
public
records
regarding
the
property.
Additional
information
is
obtained
from
both
a
physical
inspection
of
the
property
and
from
interviews
with
people
who
are
familiar
with
the
property.
The
goal
of
a
phase
I
audit
is
to
determine
the
presence
or
the
likely
presence
of
hazardous
substances
in
the
buildings,
soil
or
ground
water.
Phase
I
audits
are
noninvasive
and
do
not
include
the
collection
or
analysis
of
samples.
Accordingly,
the
findings
of
a
phase
I
audit
cannot
be
conclusive.
The
audit
merely
determines
whether
further
investigations
are
needed.
Phase
II
audit
An
environmental
liability
risk
assessment.
A
phase
II
audit
is
usually
conducted
only
when
the
phase
I
audit
or
other
information
about
the
property
or
about
the
activities
conducted
on
the
property
indicate
that
there
is
a
possibility
of
contamination.
In
the
phase
II
audit,
qualified
individuals
collect
ground
and
water
samples,
test
storage
tanks,
and/or
collect
building
materials
samples.
Drilling
may
be
conducted
to
obtain
subsurface
soil
samples.
Samples
are
then
tested
and
analyzed.

of
mortgage
loans
backing
an

Positioning
The
act
of
holding
a
financial
instrument,
one
or
more
portfolios
of
financial
instruments,
or
one’s
entire
balance
sheet
in
a
way
that
exposes
the
holder
to
profits
or
losses
from
future
changes
in
market
prices.
Positions
may
be
taken
with
the
intent
to
profit
from
expected
future
market
changes
(trading
activities);
may
result
from
inventories
of
financial
assets
maintained
for
sale
to
customers
(dealing
activities);
or
may
be
the
result
of
the
net
exposure
from
transactions
(residual
positions
resulting
from
trading
activities,
dealing
activities,
or
customer
accommodations).
Banks
take
positions
in
one
of
two
ways:
(1)
In
their
trading
accounts,
banks
(mainly
large
banks)
may
take
positions
with
one
or
more
financial
instruments
in
the
expectation
of
profiting
from
future
rate
changes.
(2)
More
typically,
banks
hold
or
take
balance
sheet
positions.
The
cumulative
interest
rate
risk
exposure
from
customer
deposits,
loans,
and
other
activities
creates
a
net
residual
position
that
the
bank
may
or
may
not
hedge.
Choosing
not
to
hedge
is
positioning.
Alternatively,
banks
may
create
a
position
or
add
to
a
residual
position
in
the
expectation
of
profiting
from
them.
Positive
convexity
A
particular
type
of
instability
in
the
duration
of
an
instrument.
Positive
convexity
means
that
as
yields
rise,
duration
declines.
Graphically,
this
is
seen
as
a
price/yield
curve
for
which
the
price
at
very
low
and
very
high
yields
exceeds
the
price
indicated
by
a
straight,
tangent
line.
For
an
instrument
with
positive
convexity,
duration
overstates
the
interest
rate
sensitivity.
If
convexity
is
low,
that
is,
if
the
price/yield
relationship
is
close
to
a
straight
line,
duration
is
stable.
If
convexity
is
high,
duration
is
unstable.
The
greater
an
instrument's
convexity,
the
less
accurate
duration
will
be.
Positive
correlation
See
correlation.
Positive
duration
(1)
The
name
for
a
particular
relationship
between
changes
in
the
price
of
a
debt
security
and
changes
in
prevailing
interest
rates.
When
a
security
has
positive
duration,
its
price
increases
in
response
to
a
decrease
in
prevailing
market
rates.
Almost
all
securities
have
positive
duration.
Note
that
the
term
"duration"
as
used
in
this
definition
refers
to
modified
duration.
See
convexity,
modified
duration
and
negative
duration.
(2)
For
a
financial
institution,
a
situation
in
which
the
total
duration
of
its
assets
is
longer
than
the
total
duration
of
its
liabilities.
In
such
cases,
the
duration
of
equity
is
positive.
In
other
words,
an
entity
with
long-term
assets
funded
by
short-term
liabilities
will
have
a
positive
duration
of
equity.
A
financial
institution
that
has
a
positive
duration
of
equity
may
also
be
described
as
having
a
negative
gap
or
as
being
liability
sensitive.
The
theoretical
equity
value,
but
not
necessarily
the
stock
price,
of
a
financial
institution
with
a
positive
duration
of
equity
will
decrease
if
interest
rates
rise
and
increase
if
interest
rates
decline.
Note
that
the
term
"duration"
as
used
in
this
definition
refers
to
modified
duration.
See
convexity,
modified
duration
and
negative
duration.
Positive
gap
A
term
referring
to
an
asset-sensitive
condition.
A
mismatch
in
which
interest-sensitive
assets
exceed
interest-sensitive
liabilities.
Positive

Preference
preference
period
A
legal
term
used
in
bankruptcy
to
describe
a
transaction
deemed
to
have
occurred
under
circumstances
favorable
to
the
creditor
that
benefited
from
the
transaction.
This
provision
is
intended
to
protect
unsecured
creditors.
Under
the
U.S.
Bankruptcy
Code,
the
preference
period
for
most
creditors
is
90
days
prior
the
date
of
the
debtor's
petition
filing.
The
exception
is
a
one
year
preference
period
applicable
to
creditors
deemed
to
be
an
"insider"
with
respect
to
the
bankrupt
debtor.
Collateral
interests
obtained
by
a
creditor
during
the
preference
period
are
undone
by
the
bankruptcy.

Preferred
stock
A
type
of
equity
or
capital
representing
shares
of
ownership
in
a
corporation.
May
or
may
not
receive
distributions
of
corporate
income
in
the
form
of
dividends.
Has
a
higher
priority
claim
to
corporate
earnings
or
assets
than
common
stock
but
lower
priority
than
corporate
debt.
A
corporation
may
issue
more
than
one
class
of
preferred
stock
with
differing
priority
status
such
as
first
or
second
preferred.
Often
preferred
stock
issues
have
a
defined
dividend
payment
rate
as
long
as
there
are
sufficient
corporate
earnings
to
distribute.
Premium

that
must
be
paid
above
the

amount
for
an
issuer
to
call
or
refund
an
issue
before
its
maturity.
(3)
The
amount
paid
to
purchase
an

(4
The
cost
of
an

policy.
(5)
In
banking,
the
segment
of
an
interest
rate
that
is
offered
or
paid
by
one
issuer
representing
the
difference
between
the
rate
offered
or
paid
by
that
issuer
and
the
rate
that
other
issuers
of
the
same
type
offer
or
pay
for
similar
issues.
For
example,
the
extra
or
higher
interest
rate
that
a
distressed
bank
must
pay
above
rates
offered
by
other
banks
in
order
to
attract
funds.
Premium
payer
The
party
in
an
options
collar
contract
required
to

Prepaids
Expenses
that
are
capitalized
as
assets
on
a
firm's
financial
statements
because
they
will
be
charged
against
activities
in
the
near
future
rather
than
past
activities.
Also
called
prepaid
expenses,
prepaid
assets
or
prepaid
items.
For
example,
if
insurance
premiums
for
the
next
six
months
are
paid
today,
the
amount
paid
may
be
shown
as
a
pre-
paid
asset.
The
asset
in
that
example
would
then
be
reduced
to
zero
over
the
following
six
months
by
recognizing
one-sixth
of
the
amount
as
an
expense
in
each
of
next
six
months.
Insurance,
taxes,
and
subscriptions
are
common
prepaid
expenses.
Prepayment
estimate
A
reasonable
and
supportable
forecast
of
loan
prepayments.
In
the
case
of
a
mortgage-backed
security,
it
is
the
forecast
of
principal
amortization
caused
by
loan
prepayments.
A
single
prepayment
estimate
is
associated
with
each
projected
interest
rate
environment.
Estimates
are
used
to
forecast
expected
lives.
Investors
typically
examine
data
for
a
range
of
prepayment
estimates
applicable
to
a
range
of
preselected
rate
changes.
Prepayment
or
prepayments
(1)
noun
—
A
term
used
to
describe
loan
or
bond
principal
payments
that
are
made
in
excess
of
the
scheduled
principal
payments
and
before
maturity.
Any
amount
paid
to
reduce
the
principal
before
the
due
date
or
in
excess
of
the
required
principal
amortization.
Prepayments
may
be
voluntary
or
involuntary.
For
example,
most
residential
mortgage
loan
contracts
permit
the
homeowner
to
voluntarily
prepay
his
or
her
loan
at
any
time.
Involuntary
prepayments
are
liquidations
resulting
from
foreclosures,
condemnations,
or
casualty.
2)
verb
—
The
action
of
making
excess
or
early
payments.
Prepayment
penalty
A
fee
that
must
be
paid
to
the
lender
if
the
borrower
prepays
a
loan
within
a
defined
time
period.
Many
consumer
loans,
especially
residential
mortgage
loans,
do
not
have
prepayment
penalties.
Prepayment
rate
A
representation
that
reflects
the
rate
at
which
prepayments
are
received
or
forecasted
to
be
received
for
a
mortgage
loan,
a
pool
of
mortgage
loans,
or
an

as
a
PSA
or
CPR
speed.
Prepayment
risk
The
risk
that
prepayments
will
speed
or
slow
and
therefore
change
the
yield
and/or
life
of
the
security.
Pre-refunding
(pre-re)
The
sale
of
bonds
used
to
obtain
funds
that
are
then
placed
in
escrow
to
back
bonds
previously
issued.
The
first
issue
typically
comprises
bonds
that
were
originally
issued
at
high,
fixed
coupon
rates
and
that
could
not
be
called
when
rates
subsequently
fell.
Since
they
could
not
be
called,
the
issuer’s
alternative
method
for
reducing
its
interest
cost
for
the
debt
is
to
issue
new,
lower
cost
debt
and
to
use
the
proceeds
of
the
new
bonds
to
purchase
Treasury
securities.
The
interest
received
from
the
Treasury
securities
pays
the
interest
due
for
the
pre-refunded
bonds
until
they
can
be
called
or
until
they
mature.
The
original
set
of
bonds
is
said
to
be
pre-refunded
by
the
second
set
of
bonds.
Those
pre-refunded
bonds
have
very
little
credit
risk
since
the
cash
for
their
debt
service
comes
from
the
Treasury
securities
and
does
not
depend
on
the
issuer.
See
refunding
escrow
deposits.
Presentment
A
process
by
which
a
check
is
presented
for
payment
at
the
drawee’s
bank.
Price
The
amount
paid
for
a
security.
The
price
of
a
security
is
usually
expressed
as
a
percentage
of
its
par
value.
For
mortgage-related
securities,
the
price
is
usually
expressed
as
a
percentage
of
the
current
face
value.
A
price
greater
than
100
percent
is
a
premium
price
while
a
price
less
than
100
percent
is
a
discount
price.
See
current
face,
discount,
par
and
premium.
Price
risk
The
risk
that
the
market
value
of
an
asset
or
liability
will
change
adversely.
One
of
nine
risks
defined
by
the
OCC.
The
OCC
defines
price
risk
as
the
risk
to
earnings
or
capital
arising
from
adverse
changes
in
the
value
of
portfolios
of
financial
instruments.
Since
such
adverse
changes
generally
result
from
changes
in
prevailing
interest
rates,
price
risk
is
essentially
the
same
as
interest
rate
risk.
The
Federal
Reserve
includes
this
risk
in
its
definition
of
market
risk.
See
interest
rate
risk
and
market
risk.
Primary
market
The
issuance
(sale)
of
new
securities.
As
distinguished
from
the
secondary
market.
Primary
reserves
For
a
bank,
assets
considered
to
be
the
primary
source
of
extra
liquidity.
Primary
reserves
are
usually
defined
to
be
cash
on
hand,
balances
on
deposit
with
the
Federal
Reserve
Bank,
and
balances
due
from
correspondent
banks
(e.g.,
cash
and
due
from
banks).
Principal
The
remaining
balance
owed
on
a
loan
by
a
borrower
or
on
a
security
by
its
issuer,
exclusive
of
any
accrued
interest.
Principal
component
analysis
(PCA)
A
mathematical
tool
used
to
reduce
the
number
of
variables
while
retaining
the
original
variability
of
the
data
The
first
principal
component
accounts
for
as
much
of
the
variability
in
the
data
as
possible,
and
each
succeeding
component
accounts
for
as
much
of
the
remaining
variability
as
possible.
In
interest
rate
risk
analysis,
PCA
is
applied
to
define
non-parallel
yield
curve
sifts
to
model.
The
number
of
variables
is
equal
to
the
number
of
points
on
the
yield
curve,
the
first
principal
component
is
the
rate
level,
the
second
is
the
twist
or
rotation
of
the
yield
curve
around
a
pivot
point
and
the
third
is
the
change
in
curvature
or
"bow"
in
the
yield
curve.
Principal-only
strip
(P/O)
A
form
of
stripped
mortgage-backed
security
that
only
passes
principal
payments
received
from
the
underlying
mortgage
loans
to
the
security
owners.
May
be
a
REMIC
tranche.
Prior
service
costs
Costs
that
arise
from
amendments
to
defined
benefit
pension
plans
that
retroactively
increase
benefits.
In
rare
cases,
retroactive
amendments
that
decrease
benefits
can
create
negative
prior
service
costs.
Under
FAS
87
rules,
these
costs
are
not
added
to
the
minimum
pension
liability
reported
on
the
balance
sheets
for
sponsors
of
underfunded
defined
benefit
pension
plans.
Instead,
the
costs
are
amortized
over
the
projected
remaining
service
lives
for
the
employees
expected
to
receive
benefits.
The
amortization
increases
the
reported
benefit
expense
of
the
sponsoring
firm.
The
unamortized
portion
of
this
off-balance
sheet
liability
is
disclosed
as
"unrecognized
prior
service
costs"
in
a
footnote
to
the
financial
statements.
Private
placement
Instead
of
being
sold
to
the
general
public
after
completion
of
an
SEC
registration,
some
bonds
are
sold
privately,
without
a
registration,
to
one
or
a
few
investors.
When
a
bond
issue
is
underwritten
in
this
way,
it
is
called
a
private
placement.
Private
pool
private
label
Mortgage-backed
securities
not
issued
by
or
guaranteed
by
a
U.S
government
agency
or
U.S.
government
sponsored
enterprise.
The
mortgage
loans
comprising
private
pools
are
generally
loans
that
do
not
meet
GNMA,
FNMA,
or
FHLMC
requirements.
Private
pools
may
be
structured
as
fixed-rate
pass-through
securities,
floating-rate
pass-through
securities,
or
CMOs.
Also
known
as
whole
loan
pools.
Pro
formas
or
pro
forma
statements
Financial
information,
often
just
balance
sheets,
prepared
by
adjusting
a
recent
financial
report
to
show
the
effect
of
recent
or
planned
changes.
Projected
financial
statements.
Probability
distribution
The
mathematical
function
describing
the
probability
of
different
events,
as
described
by
values
for
a
variable.
A
symmetrical
distribution
(one
where
to
values
are
evenly
distributed
around
the
mean)
is
called
a
bell
curve,
a
normal
distribution
or
Gaussian
bell
curve.
Values
that
are
far
more
widely
spread
from
the
mean
are
said
to
have
"fat
tails",
an
informal
name
for
kurtosis.
Credit
risk
and
liquidity
risk
have
distributions
that
are
very
asymmetrical
a
phenomena
called
"skewness".
Proceeds
Money
or
property
received
when
collateral
is
sold,
exchanged,
or
collected.
Processed
goods
Goods
that
become
part
of
a
product
or
mass
of
goods.
An
example
is
the
flour
used
to
bake
bread.
Processing
float
The
internal
processing
time
that
an
organization
takes
to
prepare
a
receipt
for
a
deposit
or
an
invoice
for
payment.
Products
Property
that
is
created
from
other
property.
Professional
corporations
Entities
sometimes
used
by
doctors,
lawyers,
and
other
professionals.
These
entities
can
provide
favorable
tax
treatment
and
administrative
advantages
and
can
therefore
be
advantageous
to
the
professionals
who
use
them.
In
most
respects,
other
than
taxes,
they
are
indistinguishable
from
all
other
corporations.
Progress
payments
Progress
payments
are
payments
made
by
the
purchaser
in
stages
as
the
seller
acquires
or
builds
the
property
to
be
sold.
A
written
purchase
agreement
or
contract
establishes
the
seller's
rights
to
claim
payments
before
the
property
is
delivered
to
the
buyer.
When
the
Federal
government
is
making
progress
payments,
the
purchase
contracts
usually
include
standard
clauses
that
affect
secured
lenders.
These
clauses
provide
that
title
to
all
materials,
inventory,
fixtures,
and
equipment
that
are
chargeable
to
the
government
contract
vests
in
the
government.
Projected
benefit
obligation
(PBO)
The
actuarial
present
value
of
the
pension
benefits
earned
to
date.
In
contrast
to
the
ABO,
measurement
of
the
projected
benefit
obligation
incorporates
assumptions
for
future
compensation
rates
for
pay-related
benefit
plans.
The
PBO
must
be
disclosed
in
a
footnote
to
the
financial
statements.
Projections
Projected
financial
statements
showing
predicted
income,
cash
flow,
and/or
balance
sheets.
Unlike
pro
forma
statements,
projections
typically
cover
multiple
time
periods
—
sometimes
as
many
as
five
future
years.
Promissory
note
A
written
contract
between
a
borrower/debtor
and
a
lender/creditor
in
which
the
borrower
agrees
to
repay
a
loan
granted
by
the
lender.
The
contract
specifies
the
amount
of
the
loan
and
the
terms
of
repayment.
Proprietary
trading
Trading
activity
that
is
conducted
purely
for
the
anticipated
profit
of
the
trading
entity.
The
term
is
used
to
distinguish
such
trades
from
trading
that
is
conducted
for
customers,
for
market-making,
or
for
hedging.
Also
called
strategic
trading.
Proprietorship
Name
used
to
identify
a
business
that
is
not
a
separate
legal
entity
but
instead
is
operated
by
an
individual.
Prospectus
A
document
that
describes
the
details
and
financial
support
for
a
new
bond
or
stock
issue
offering.
A

Prothonotary
The
name
used
in
some
states,
(e.g.,
Pennsylvania)
for
the
public
official
responsible
for
receiving
and
maintaining
public
notices
of
liens
such
as
financing
statements.
Usually
a

Prudential
liquidity
Liquidity
held

cushion.
Also
called
standby
liquidity.
PSA
See
Bond
Market
Association
and
PSA
model.
PSA
model
One
of
two
standard
models
for
describing
the
rate
at
which
prepayments
have
been,
are,
or
are
expected
to
be
received
for
mortgages
and
mortgage-backed
securities.
The
model
assumes
that
borrowers
are
far
less
likely
to
refinance
a
new
mortgage
than
they
are
to
refinance
an
older
mortgage.
Thus
the
PSA
model
builds
in
an
assumption
of
a
30-month
phasein
or
ramp-up
of
prepayments.
After
a
mortgage
or
a
pool
of
mortgages
is
30
months
old,
a
speed
of
100
percent
PSA
is
equal
to
6
percent
CPR.
Similarly,
a
speed
of
200
percent
PSA
is
equal
to
12
percent
CPR
and
50
percent
PSA
is
equal
to
3
percent
CPR.
During
the
initial
30-month
ramp-up,
the
PSA
model
assumes
much
slower
speeds.
For
the
first
month,
100
percent
PSA
equals
0.20
percent
CPR.
In
the
second
month,
100
percent
PSA
equals
0.40
percent
CPR.
This
level
rate
of
increase
continues
throughout
the
30-month
period.
PSA
is
the
standard
prepayment
model
of
the
Bond
Market
Association,
formerly
the
Public
Securities
Association.
The
letters
PSA
were
once
an
acronym
for
the
former
organization
name
but
now
stand
for
"prepayment
speed
assumptions."

Public
records
The
records
maintained
by
a
filing
authority
that
record
the
ownership
and/or
security
interests
held
in
property.
Under
Article
9
of
the
Uniform
Commercial
Code
(UCC),
creditors
can
perfect
interests
in
a
debtor’s
personal
property
by
recording
a
lien
in
the
public
records.
Some
states
require
such
UCC
filings
to
be
made
in
a
central,
state-wide
location.
Other
states
require
UCC
filings
to
be
made
in
public
records
maintained
locally
in
each
county.
Both
ownership
and
liens
in
real
property
are
usually
recorded
in
public
records
maintained
by
each
county.
Public
Securities
Association
(PSA)
Former
name
for
the

Public
warehouse
A
central
warehouse
that
accepts,
stores,
and
delivers
goods
for
multiple
businesses.
Often,
public
warehouses
are
bonded.
Importers
often
use
bonded
public
warehouses
located
in
or
near
points
of
entry
to
delay
payment
of
duties.
Food
is
often
kept
in
public
warehouses,
including
grain
elevators.
Public
warehouses
issue
collateral
receipts
or
warehouse
receipts
and
can
be
used
for
controlling
inventory
pledged
to
secure
loans.
See
warehouse
receipt.
Purchase
money
interest
A
security
interest
in
a
debtor's
property
that
is
created
when
the
creditor's
extension
of
credit
to
the
debtor
is
used
by
the
debtor
to
acquire
the
property
that
is
used
to
secure
the
transaction.
Put
A
contract
that
gives
its
holder
the
right
to
sell
an
underlying
security,
commodity,
or
currency
on
or
before
a
certain
date.
The
sale
option
is
for
a
predetermined
price
called
the
strike
price.
Options
are
often
used
in
hedging.
See
American
option
and
European
option.
Puttable
advance
A
loan
granted
to
a
member
financial
institution
by
a
Federal
Home
Loan
Bank.
The
put
feature
in
a
puttable
advance
enables
the
borrower
to
prepay
the
advance,
in
whole
or
in
part,
in
the
event
that
prevailing
rates
decline.
Borrowers
benefit
when
using
this
type
of
borrowing
to
fund
loans
or
investments
that
prepay
when
prevailing
interest
rates
fall.
Putable
swap
A
pay
fixed/receive
floating
swap
that
grants
the
holder
the
option
to
cancel
the
swap
before
its
maturity.
Qualified
opinion
Term
used
to
describe
the
opinion
letter
accompanying
audited
financial
statements
in
which
the
CPA
reports
the
same
information
as
in
the
unqualified
opinion
with
one
or
more
additions.
The
additional
information
describes
either
(1)
one
or
more
material
aspects
of
the
scope
of
the
audit
that
may
be
deviations
from
necessary
practice
or
(2)
uncertainty
about
the
future
that
either
cannot
be
resolved
or
the
effect

Quality
spread
The
difference
in
yield
between
a
risk-free
obligation,
an
obligation
of
the
U.
S.
Treasury,
and
another
obligation
of
similar
maturity
that
has
credit
risk.
This
difference
is
expressed
in
basis
points.
The
most
common
quality
spread
is
the
Treasury-Eurodollar
spread
(TED
spread).
Quality
spreads
are
expressions
of
credit
risk
as
yield
differentials.

spread.
Quick
ratio
A
commonly
used,
but
not
always
accurate,
proxy
for
a
firm’s
liquidity.
The
quick
ratio
is
calculated
by
subtracting
inventory
from
current
assets
and
then
dividing
the
result
by
current
liabilities.
Sometimes
called
the
acid
test
ratio.
Quit
claim
deed
A
document
by
which
title
to
real
estate
is
conveyed
from
one
party,
the
grantor,
to
another
party,
the
grantee.
The
distinguishing
characteristic
of
a
quit
claim
deed
is
that
it
transfers
only
such
interest,
title,
or
right
that
the
grantor
has
at
the
time
of
conveyance
to
the
grantee.
A
quit
claim
deed
is
common
in
divorce
or
other
situations
such
as
equitable
interests,
in
which
the
grantor’s
interest
is
not
clearly
defined.
Ramp
(1)
A
steady,
noninstantaneous
change
in
rates.
Usually
a
projected
change
in
rates
with
small,
equal,
incremental
changes
in
each
time
period
over
a
series
of
time
periods
until
the
full
amount
of
the
projected
change
is
achieved.

A
term
used
in
residential
lending
and
in
the
analysis
of
mortgage
backed
securities
to
describe
projections
of
monthly
prepayment
speeds
which
increase
from
a
low
initial
rate
over
a
series
of
time
periods
until
the
full
amount
of
the
expected,
final
prepayment
speed
is
reached.

Rate
The
cost
of
debt
service
paid
by
a
borrower
or
issuer
to
a
lender
or
investor.
The
rate
is
expressed
as
an
annual
percentage
of
the
amount
borrowed.
For
some
notes
and
bonds
that
pay
interest
semiannually,
the
semiannual
interest
due
to
the
investor
used
to
be
evidenced
by
a
coupon
that
could
be
detached
and
sent
for
collection.
Thus
the
cost
to
the
issuer
for
notes
and
bonds
paying
semiannual
interest
is
often
called
the
coupon
rate.
Lenders
or
investors
may
receive
a
yield
that
is
higher
or
lower
than
the
rate.
Rate
covenant
A
provision
in
the
bond
agreement
or
resolution
that
addresses
the
rate
or
method
used
to
establish
the
fee(s)
charged
to
users
of
the
facility
financed
by
the
securities.
Typically,
a
rate
covenant
promises
that
the
fees
will
be
adjusted
when
necessary
to
support
the
timely
payment
of
interest
and
principal
on
the
bonds.
Rate
risk
The
risk
that
the
entity's
earnings
and/or
its
capital
may
be
reduced
by
an
adverse
change
in
prevailing
interest
rates.
Rate
sensitive
The
exposure
of
either
the
bank's
earnings
or
its
market
value
to
fluctuations
caused
by
changes
in
prevailing

Rate-sensitive
assets
(RSA)
The
quantity
of

Usually
related
to
rate-sensitive

Rate-sensitive
liabilities
(RSL)
The

Real
estate
investment
trust
(REIT)
A
trust
used
to
hold
ownership
of
real
property
for
investors.
The
trust
structure
is
used
to
benefit
from
tax
code
provisions.
Real
estate
mortgage
investment
conduit
(REMIC)
The
name
of
a
type
of
mortgage-backed
pass-through
security.
REMICs
can
take
many
forms.
REMICs
are
typically
multiclass
securities.
Unlike
simple,
non-REMIC
CMOs,
REMICs
can
separate
mortgage
pools
into
different
risk
classes
as
well
as
different
maturity
classes.
Some
of
the
most
common
forms
of
REMICs
are
sequential
pay
CMOs,
planned
amortization
class
(PAC)
tranches,
targeted
amortization
class
(TAC)
tranches,
and
companion
tranches.
REMICs
may
also
have
interest-only
tranches,
principal-only
tranches,
and
residual
tranches.
Today
almost
all
CMOs
are
issued
in
REMIC
form
to
take
advantage
of
provisions
in
the
Tax
Reform
Act
of
1986.
However,
even
though
REMICs
are
overwhelmingly
dominant
in
the
CMO
market,
the
term
"REMIC"
is
used
far
less
often
than
the
term
"CMO."
CMO
is
used
to
refer
to
all
forms
of
MBSs
other
than
simple
pass-through
MBS
pools.
Real
Estate
Settlement
Procedures
Act
(RESPA)
A
Federal
statute
that
requires
lenders
and
persons
who
conduct
real
estate
loan
closings
(settlements)
to
make
certain
disclosures.
The
law
also
prohibits
certain
practices
such
as
kickbacks.
The
Department
of
Housing
and
Urban
Development
(HUD)
has
adopted
Regulation
X
to
implement
this
statute.
Real
property
Informally
used
to
refer
to
land
or
buildings.
As
defined
by
Federal
banking
regulations
governing
appraisals,
real
property
is:
an
identified
parcel
or
tract
of
land
including
improvements,
easements,
rights
of
way,
undivided
or
future
interests,
and
similar
rights
but
excluding
mineral
rights,
timber
rights,
or
growing
crops.
Note
that
under
state
law
in
many
states,
growing
crops,
timber,
and
minerals
that
have
not
been
separated
from
the
land
are
also
included
in
the
definition
of
real
property.

Receivables
Name
used
by
bankers
to
describe
moneys
owed
to
a
business
and
yet
to
be
received.
Usually
the
amounts
due
from
trade
creditors
who
purchased
goods
or
services
on
credit.
Functionally
equivalent
to
accounts
or
accounts
receivable
except
that
accounts
is
the
only
legally
acceptable
way
to
describe
these
assets
for
purposes
of
Article
9
of
the
Uniform
Commercial
Code.
Re-CMOs
or
re-REMICs
REMICs
are
created
when
tranches
of
existing
CMO
REMICs
are
combined
and
used
to
collateralize
new
securities.
When
this
is
done,
the
new
securities
are
called
re-REMICs,
re-CMOs,
or
structured
collateral.
These
may
be
more
or
less
risky
than
the
underlying
tranches.
See
kitchen
sink
bonds.
Reconveyance

Record
date
The
date
set
to
determine
the
owner
entitled
to
the
next
dividend,
interest,
or
principal
payment.
The
payment
is
due
to
the
owner
who
owned
the
security
on
the
record
date.
Recourse
The
right
to
seek
repayment
of
debt.
Usually
used
to
describe
the
right
to
seek
repayment
from
an
originator
or
prior
endorser
who
sold
or
assigned
debt
to
another
party.
Red
lining
Term
used
to
describe
the
illegal

to
borrowers
located
in
a
defined
geographic
area.

Reference
asset
A
term
used
in
credit
swap
transactions
to
identify
the
underlying
instrument.
In
the
most
simple
structure,
cash
flow
from
the
reference
asset
is
paid
by
the
asset
owner
called
a
protection
buyer
to
a
counter-party
known
as
a
protection
seller.
The
reference
asset
is
often
a
marketable,
corporate
bond
rather
than
a
corporate
loan
from
the
same
obligor
because
the
bonds
provide
price
information
than
loans
which
are
less
homogenous
and
less
marketable.
See
credit
derivative
and
credit
swap.
Reference
rate
An
interest
rate
used
as
an
index
rate.
For
example,
if
a
loan
pays
interest
at
a
rate
of
50
basis
points
above
the
6-month
LIBOR,
the
reference
rate
is
the
6-month
LIBOR.
Refunding
The
replacement
of
existing
securities
using
funds
obtained
from
the
issuance
of
new
securities.
Refunding
bonds
Bonds
issued
to
replace
outstanding
bond
issues.
Usually
used
to
replace
callable
bonds
when
interest
rates
drop.
Refunding
escrow
deposits
(REDs)
Financial
instruments
similar
to
pre-refunding
bonds.
Tax
law
changes
in
1984
restricted
tax
exempt
pre-refundings
for
certain
types
of
municipal
debt
including
airport
and
convention
center
related
debt.
To
circumvent
those
restrictions,
a
forward
transaction,
rather
than
a
second
bond
issue,
is
used
to
lock
in
a
lower
cost
of
funding.
Under
this
arrangement,
funds
dedicated
to
repaying
higher
cost
debt
at
the
next
call
date
are
held
in
escrow.
See
pre-refunding
(pre-re).
Register

maintaining
public
notices
of
liens
such
as

Registered
A
form
of
ownership
of
certificated

and
in
the
records
of
the
issuer's

Regular
way
settlement
Buyers
and
sellers
can
negotiate
settlement
periods;
however,
standard
time
periods
are
usually
used.
For
U.S.
Treasury
and
agency
debt
securities,
the
customary
settlement
time,
called
regular
way
settlement,
is
the
next
business
day.
For
municipal
and
corporate
debt
securities,
the
customary
settlement
period,
often
called
corporate
settlement,
is
three
days.

to
closely
duplicate
the
changes
in
a
portfolio
of
instruments
with
administered
rates
and/or
indeterminate
maturities.
Sometimes
referred
to
as
the
"Rod
Jacobs"

Repo
An
informal
name
for
a
repurchase
agreement.
Repositioning
repurchase
agreement
A
funding
technique
often
used
by
dealers
who
encourage
speculation
through
the
use
of
gains
trading,
pair-off,
when-issued,
and
extended
settlement
ploys.
When
an
investor
agrees
to
purchase
a
security
with
the
intent
of
quickly
selling
it
for
a
profit,
price
movements
do
not
always
favor
these
speculations.
The
repositioning
repurchase
agreement
is
service
offered
by
dealers
to
enable
buyers
to
hold
onto
such
speculative
positions
until
prices
change
and
the
position
can
be
closed
out
at
a
profit.
In
a
repositioning
repurchase
agreement,
the
buyer
pays
the
dealer
a
small
margin
that
approximates
the
actual
loss
in
the
security.
The
dealer
then
agrees
to
fund
the
purchase
of
the
security
by
entering
into
a
repurchase/reverse
repurchase
agreement
with
the
buyer.
(The
transaction
is
a
borrowing
called
a
repurchase
agreement
for
the
buyer.
It
is
a
loan
called
a
reverse
repurchase
agreement
for
the
dealer.)
These
transactions
are
deemed
to
be
inherently
speculative.
Repossession
Taking
physical
possession
of
personal
property
collateral
pledged
to
secure
a
defaulted
loan.
Repricing
(1)
A
contractual
provision
applicable
to
specific
loans,
investments,
or
deposits
that
changes
the
interest
rate
paid
or
received.
For
example,
a
loan
may
have
an
interest
rate
tied
to
the
prime
rate
that
changes
every
time
the
prime
rate
changes,
or
an
investment
may
have
a
rate
tied
to
the
one-month
LIBOR.
It
is
immaterial
which
index,
if
any,
the
rate
is
linked
to
or
when
the
rate
adjusts.
(2)
As
used
in
asset
liability
management
(ALM),
refers
to
the
timing
of
cash
flow
from
the
principal
of
an
asset
that
is
received
by
the
bank
or
the
timing
of
payment
of
the
principal
of
a
liability
by
the
bank.
For
example,
in
the
case
of
a
5-year,
fixed-rate
investment,
the
principal
is
received
at
the
end
of
5
years,
therefore,
the
asset
reprices
at
the
end
of
the
fifth
year.
Note
that
the
end
of
the
fifth
year
could
be
tomorrow
if
the
investment
was
issued
4
years
and
364
days
ago.
In
the
case
of
a
car
loan,
an
amount
equal
to
the
monthly
principal
payments
made
to
the
bank
reprices
each
month.
In
the
case
of
a
certificate
of
deposit,
repricing
occurs
at
maturity.
Repricing
risk
See
mismatch
risk.
Repurchase
agreement
(RP)
A
form
of
secured,
short-term
borrowing
in
which
a
security
is
sold
with
a
simultaneous
agreement
to
buy
it
back
from
the
purchaser
at
a
future
date.
The
purchase
and
sales
agreements
are
simultaneous
but
the
transactions
are
not.
The
sale
is
a
cash
transaction
while
the
return
purchase
is
a
forward
transaction
since
it
occurs
at
a
future
date.
The
seller/borrower
pays
interest
to
the
buyer
at
a
rate
negotiated
between
the
parties.
Rates
paid
on
repos
are
short-term
money
market
interest
rates
and
are
completely
unrelated
to
the
coupon
rate
paid
on
the
instrument
being
purchased.
Informally
known
as
repos.
Sometimes
called
a
classic
repo
to
distinguish
between
these
transactions
and
sell/buybacks.
Every
transaction
where
a
security
is
sold
under
an
agreement
to
be
repurchased
is
a
repo
from
the
seller/borrower's
point
of
view
and
a
reverse
from
the
buyer/lender's
point
of
view.
Repos
and
reverses
are
often
used
to
finance
investment
purchases,
especially
by
traders.
Reputation
risk
One
of
nine
risks
defined
by
the
OCC
and
one
of
six
risks
defined
by
the
Federal
Reserve.
The
risk
to
earnings
or
capital
arising
from
the
possibility
that
negative
publicity
regarding
the
institution’s
business
practices,
whether
true
or
not,
will
cause
a
decline
in
its
customer
base,
costly
litigation,
or
revenue
reductions.
The
Federal
Reserve
and
the
OCC
define
reputation
risk
in
almost
exactly
the
same
way.
Request
for
proposal
(RFP)
A
written
notification
prepared
by
an
organization
requesting
offers
to
provide
certain
services
(e.g.,
banking
service)
and
to
specify
prices
for
these
services.
RFPs
are
generally
quite
detailed
as
to
the
types
of
services
needed.
Rescission
Cancellation
of
a
contract
without
penalty.
Regulation
Z
provides
circumstances
under
which
a
borrower
may
cancel
loan
transactions
involving
nonpurchase
money
liens
on
the
borrower's
principal
place
of
residence.
The
regulation
permits
such
rescissions
during
a
three
day
period
after
the
loan
closing.
Specific
requirements
apply
to
bank
disclosures
of
the
borrower’s
right
to
rescind.
Reserve
account
A
type
of
credit
enhancement
used
in
some
asset
backed
securities.
The
reserve
account
may
be
created
by
an
initial
deposit
from
the
seller
and
may
be
augmented
over
time
by
the
application
of
funds
from
excess
servicing
income.
Credit
is
enhanced
because
withdrawals
from
the
reserve
account
are
made
to
reimburse
investors
when
excess
servicing
is
insufficient
to
cover
charge
-offs.
Until
needed,
funds
in
a
reserve
account
are
invested.
Reserve
requirements
The
percentages
of
different
types
of
deposits
that
banks
are
required
to
hold
on
deposit
at
the
Federal
Reserve
or
as
cash
in
their
vaults.
These
requirements
are
determined
by
the
Federal
Reserve
Board
and
function
as
a
tool
to
control
monetary
policy.
Reset
cap
The
maximum
amount
by
which
an
adjustable-rate
security’s
coupon
rate
can
change
in
any
given
period
of
time.
Also
called
the
periodic
cap.
For
most
ARMs
and
floaters,
the
maximum
periodic
or
reset
change
is
defined
as
an
amount
of
change
in
each,
consecutive
12-month
period
over
the
life
of
the
security.
Thus
the
term
"annual"
cap
is
also
used
to
describe
most
periodic
caps.
Reset
date
The
point
in
time
when
the
coupon
rate
for
a
variable
rate
or
floating
rate
financial
instrument
is
re-established
to
reflect
changes
in
a
benchmark
index.
Reset
dates
are
typically
monthly,
quarterly,
semi-annually
or
annually.
See
index.
Residual
(1)
For
sequential-pay
CMO
structures,
a
residual
tranche
is
the
CMO
tranche
that
receives
the
excess
cash
flow
that
remains
after
all
of
the
payments
due
to
the
holders
of
other
tranches
and
all
of
the
administrative
expenses
have
been
met.
When
the
residual
is
an
accrual
bond,
it
is
often
called
a
Z
tranche
or
a
Z
bond.
(2)
In
REMIC
CMO
structures,
one
class
of
each
issue
must
be
designated
as
the
residual
for
tax
purposes.
Some
REMIC
residuals
do
not
meet
the
traditional
definition
of
a
residual
as
the
last
tranche
to
be
retired.
Residual
value
Term
used
to
describe
the
market
or
sale
value
of
leased
equipment
(net
of
removal
or
disposal
costs)
at
the
end
of
the
lease
term.
In
most
cases,
it
is
projected
or
estimated.
Sometimes
called
salvage
value.
With
some
exceptions,
national
bank
lessors
are
subject
to
a
rule
that
limits
the
residual
value
assumption
made
at
the
time
the
lease
is
created
to
25
percent
of
the
equipment's
cost.
Bank
holding
company
leasing
subsidiaries
are
subject
to
a
20
percent
limit
on
the
residual
assumption.

Restricted
appraisal
reports
One
of
three
types
of
real
estate
appraisal
reports
defined
under
Uniform
Standards
of
Professional
Appraisal
Practice
(USPAP)
rules.
A
restricted
appraisal
report
is
the
least
detailed
of
the
three
report
formats.
Given
a
bank’s
need
to
meet
both
regulatory
requirements
and
the
needs
of
prudent
loan
underwriting,
more
detailed
reports
are
almost
always
preferable.
Restricted
cash
Cash
held
subject
to
limitations
on
how
or
when
it
may
be
used.
For
example,
refundable
customer
deposits,
cash
in
escrow
accounts,
and
debt
sinking
funds.
Restricted
stock
Restricted
stock
is
stock
purchased
from
the
issuer
or
from
a
person
in
a
controlled
relationship
to
the
issuer
in
a
nonpublic
or
private
transaction.
The
right
to
sell
restricted
stock
is
limited
by
provisions
in
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Act.
Retail
deposits
(1)
Deposits
or
deposit
account
balances
in
amounts
of
$100,000
or
less.
(2)
Deposits
obtained
from
individuals
and
small
businesses
in
the
bank's
local
trade
area(s).
Retainage
The
portion
of
the
payment
due
to
a
contractor
or
equipment
builder
that
is
withheld
until
final
inspection
and
acceptance
of
the
work.
Also
called
a
holdback.
Retained
earnings
Earnings
of
a
corporation
from
the
current
as
well
as
prior
years
that
have
neither
been
distributed
to
the
shareholders
as
dividends
nor
transferred
to
the
surplus
account.
Corporate
earnings
accumulated
over
time.
One
of
a
corporation’s
equity
or
capital
accounts.
Retentions
Portions
of
contracts
that
are
not
paid
until
all
contract
provisions
are
satisfied.
Sometimes
called
holdbacks.
Return
on
assets
(ROA)
A
percentage
calculated
by
dividing
net
income
after
tax
by
total
assets.
Annual
income
is
usually
used
in
the
numerator;
however,
the
annualized
income
for
a
month,
quarter,
or
half
year
can
be
used.
Period-end
assets
is
often
used
in
this
calculation;
however,
average
assets
for
the
period
is
more
accurate.
This
ratio
is
a
measurement
of
how
profitably
assets
are
used
in
an
enterprise.
Firms
in
different
industries
usually
have
quite
different
returns
on
assets.
This
ratio
is
best
used
to
compare
firms
in
the
same
industry.
Return
on
capital
The
return
earned
by
an
investor
from
a
specific
investment
or
group
of
investments
measured
in
terms
of
a
percentage
return
on
the
amount
of
capital
invested.
See
return
on
equity.
Return
on
equity
(ROE)
A
measure
of
the
return
realized
by
the
owners
of
an
enterprise.
Calculated
by
dividing
an
enterprise’s
annualized
net
income
by
its
average
capital
for
the
period.
Alternatively,
it
can
be
calculated
by
multiplying
the
enterprise’s
ROA
by
its
leverage/equity
multiplier.
ROE
indicates
how
effectively
the
enterprise
is
using
its
capital
to
produce
income.
Returns
Reductions
to
gross
sales
that
occur
when
customers
are
given
credit
for
sold
goods
that
are
returned
to
the
firm.
Revenue
anticipation
note
(RAN)
A
short-term
note
sold
by
a
public
entity
that
will
be
repaid
from
the
proceeds
of
anticipated
nontax
income.
Revenue
obligation
A
bond
or
note
for
which
the
payments
of
principal
and
interest
made
to
the
investors
by
the
issuer
are
payable
exclusively
from
the
earnings
of
the
underlying
project.
For
example,
turnpike
bonds
repaid
from
tolls.
Reverse
An
informal
name
for
a
reverse
repurchase
agreement.
Reverse
repurchase
agreement,
reverse
repo
A
form
of
secured,
short-term
investment
in
which
a
security
is
purchased
with
a
simultaneous
agreement
to
sell
it
back
to
the
seller
at
a
future
date.
The
purchase
and
sales
agreements
are
simultaneous
but
the
transactions
are
not.
The
purchase
is
a
cash
transaction
while
the
return
sale
is
a
forward
transaction
since
it
occurs
at
a
future
date.
Informally
known
as
a
reverse.
The
buyer/investor/lender
earns
interest
paid
at
rate
negotiated
between
the
parties.
Rates
paid
on
reverse
repos
are
short-term
money
market
interest
rates
and
are
completely
unrelated
to
the
coupon
rate
paid
on
the
instrument
being
purchased.
Every
transaction
where
a
security
is
sold
under
an
agreement
to
be
repurchased
is
a
repo
from
the
seller/borrower's
point
of
view
and
a
reverse
from
the
buyer/lender's
point
of
view.
Repos
and
reverses
are
often
used
to
finance
investment
purchases,
especially
by
traders.
Reverse
TAC
tranche
The
opposite
of
a
TAC
tranche.
Bonds
created
in
scheduled-pay
CMO
structures.
A
reverse
TAC
tranche
is
structured
to
avoid
prepayment
volatility.
Each
TAC
has
a
designated
target
speed.
When
prepayments
fall
below
the
targeted
speed,
excess
cash
flow
is
diverted
to
the
reverse
TAC
tranche.
Unlike
a
PAC,
a
TAC
tranche
is
not
protected
from
call
risk
if
prepayments
are
faster
than
expected.
For
this
reason,
TACs
can
be
viewed
as
half
PACs.
Reverse
TACs
offer
investors
protection
(but
not
immunity)
from
extension
risk
but
no
protection
from
call
risk.
Sometimes
called
contraction
bonds
because
of
their
call
risk.
Review
statements
Financial
statements
prepared
by
an
independent
CPA
that
have
been
subject
to
some
examination
but
have
not
been
audited.
The
CPA
is
required
to
consider
the
reasonableness
of
the
information.
If
any
number
appears
questionable,
the
CPA
must
make
inquiries,
apply
analytical
procedures
or
take
other
appropriate
actions
to

Revolving
line
of
credit
A
type
of
credit
facility.
A
term
that
can
be
confusing,
with
different
banks
using
the
term
to
describe
different
types
of
credit
facilities.
In
some
banks,
"revolving
line
of
credit"
refers
to
a
credit
facility
that
permits
the
borrower
to
draw
down
and/or
repay
amounts
up
to
a
specified
maximum
at
any
time.
Called
a
line
of
credit
by
other
banks.
In
other
banks,
the
name
"revolving
line
of
credit"
is
used
to
distinguish
between
"regular
lines
of
credit,"
(situations
in
which
the
bank
is
not
legally
committed
to
make
advances)
and
"revolving
lines,"
(situations
in
which
the
bank
is
legally
committed
to
make
advances.)
This
usage
is
outdated,
wrong,
and
might
expose
the
bank
to
legal
liability.
Large
banks,
primarily,
use
the
term
to
refer
to
a
combination
of
a
line
of
credit
and
a
term
loan.
Typically
it
starts
out
as
a
line
for
a
one-to-three
year
period,
after
which,
on
a
previously
determined
date,
the
outstanding
balance
converts
to
an
amortizing
term
loan.
Revolving
period
A
term
used
for
asset
backed
securities
to
describe
a
period
of
time
during
which
principal
payments
received
from
the
underlying
loan
collateral
are
reinvested
in
new
loan
receivables
thereby
enabling
the
investor/ABS
balance
to
remain
constant.
A
revolving
period
may
be
prematurely
terminated
by
an
early
amortization
event.

Risk
(1)
Noun
—
The
possibility
of
loss.
(2)
Noun
—
The
uncertainty
of
whether
events,
expected
or
otherwise,
will
have
an
adverse
impact.
In
this
context,
the
adverse
impact
is
usually
a
quantity
of
return
(income)
or
value
at
risk.
(3)
Noun
—
the
compound
estimate
of
the
probability
of,
and
the
severity
of,
an
adverse
event.
The
amount
of
risk
is
the
product
of
the
probability
of
the
adverse
consequence
and
the
potential
severity
of
that
adverse
consequence.
(4)
Verb
—
to
incur
the
possibility
of
loss,
to
create
or
accept
the

Risk-adjusted
return
on
capital
(RAROC)
An
economic
approach
to
measure
unit
and
product
profitability
within
a
financial
institution.
Returns,
adjusted
to
reflect
normalized
or
expected
losses,
are
divided
by
an
amount
of
capital
that
is
carefully
quantified
to
reflect
the
risk
or
risks
incurred
to
generate
those
returns.
The
total
risk-adjusted
capital
for
an
entire
financial
institution
reflects
its
calculated
economic
capital.
Economic
capital
is
the
capital
required
to
support
the
incurred
risks.
Economic
capital
will
rarely,
if
ever,
equal
accounting
or
book-value
capital.
The
risk-adjusted
return
on
capital
is
usually
compared
to
a
standard
or
hurdle
rate
of
return.
When
such
comparisons
are
made,
products
or
units
with
returns
exceeding
the
hurdle
rate
are
said
to
add
value
while
products
or
units
with
returns
below
the
hurdle
rate
are
said
to
destroy
value.
RAROC
is
not
always
defined
and
applied
exactly
the
same
way
by
different
financial
institutions
but
must
be
defined
and
applied
consistently
throughout
each
financial
institution
that
uses
it.
Often
referred
to
by
the
acronym
RAROC,
pronounced
"ray-rock."
Risk-adjusted
return
Risk-adjusted
rate
of
return
The
profit,
often
but
not
always
expressed
as
a
percentage
rate
of
return
on
allocated
capital,
after
recognizing
applicable
costs
for
credit
risk,
interest
rate
risk,
liquidity
risk
and/or
other
financial
risks.
In
some
measures,
risk
costs
are
treated
as
expenses.
In
other
measures,
they
are
reflected
in
the
amount
of
capital
allocated
in
the
denominator
of
the
return
on
capital
ratio.
Risk-based
capital
Rules
for
establishing
minimum
required
levels
of
book
capital
for
financial
institutions.
Capital
is
allocated
to
types
of
bank
assets
based
upon
weightings
assigned
to
those
assets.
For
example,
U.S.
Treasury
obligations
and
some
U.S.
Agency
obligations
require
no
capital.
Most
other
U.S.
Agency
obligations
are
given
a
20
percent
weighting
for
the
purpose
of
calculating
risk-based
capital.
Corporate
obligations
have
a
100
percent
weighting.
Risk-based
pricing
The
practice
of
charging
different
rates
to
different
borrowers
based
on
differences
in
their
credit
worthiness.
Typically,
all
other
loan
terms
remain
the
same.
See
Fair
and
Accurate
Transactions
Act
(FACT
Act)
for
limitations
on
the
application
of
risk-based
pricing
to
consumer
loans.
Risk
management
Controlling
the
probability,
and/or
the
severity,
of
a
potential
adverse
event
so
that
the
consequences
of
that
event
are
within
acceptable
limits.
Since
all
risks
have,
by
definition,
the
potential
to
generate
losses,
and
since
capital
is
the
ultimate
protection
against
failure
resulting
from
losses,
the
underlying
basis
of
risk
management
is
equivalent
to
managing
solvency
risk.
Risk
measurement
unit
(RMU)
A
defined
quantity
or
unit
of
risk.
Quantities
of
risk
may
be
defined
for
the
purposes
of
setting
risk
exposure
limits
or
for
the
purposes
of
allocating
capital
to
measure
risk-adjusted
returns
on
capital.
RMUs
are
often
defined
in
terms
of
the
amount
of
change
or
volatility
that
is
equal
to
one
standard
deviation
of
the
volatility.

Scenario
analysis
(1)
In
investment
analysis,
the
process
of
examining
the
anticipated
performance
of
an
investment
under
a
variety
of

environments.
(2)
In
bank
asset/liability
management,
the
process
of
modeling
the
anticipated
effects
of
interest
rate
changes
on
the
net
income
or
capital
of
a

Screw
clause
(for
convertible
bonds)
An
informal
market
term
for
a
contractual
clause
or
provision
in
the
indenture
agreement
for
a
convertible
bond.
A
screw
clause
provides
that,
upon
conversion,
the
convertible
bondholder
may
not
receive
accrued
interest
on
the
bond.
Screw
clauses
may
work
in
different
ways.
For
example,
the
first
call
date
may
coincide
with
an
interest
payment
date
and
the
conversion
rights
may
expire
just
before
the
interest
payment
date.
In
that
example,
an
investor
cannot
take
advantage
of
the
bond’s
conversion
feature
without
failing
to
hold
the
bond
long
enough
to
receive
the
semiannual
interest
payment.
Another
example
is
a
mandatory
convertible
bond
that
requires
conversion
before
the
interest
pay
date.
Seasoned
issue
or
seasoned
security
A
mortgage-backed

Loans
for
which
a

began.
GNMA
requires
that
mortgages
within
a
given
pool
be
originated
within
two
years
of
the

SEC
yield
A
measure
of
return
for

of
the
calculation
by
the
net

Securities
lending
The
temporary
transfer
of
securities
from
an
investor’s
portfolio
to
a
counterparty
borrower.
The
counterparty
may
borrow
to
cover
securities
transaction
fails
(securities
sold
but
for
some
reason
unavailable
for
delivery
to
the
buyers),
short
sales,
or
other
trading
activities
such
as
arbitrage.
While
corporate
stocks
used
to
be
the
most
common
securities
lent,
U.S.
government
and
agency
securities
now
comprise
a
major
portion
of
this
activity.
Securities
loans
are
usually
secured
by
the
pledge
of
U.S.
government
or
agency
bonds.
Alternatively,
cash
or
letters
of
credit
may
back
some
securities
loans.
The
value
of
the
collateral
pledged
exceeds
the
value
of
the
securities
lent
by
an
agreed-upon
collateral
margin.
When
a
securities
loan
is
terminated,
the
securities
are
returned
to
the
lender
and
the
collateral
is
returned
to
the
borrower.
The
two
main
risks
in
securities
lending
are
counterparty
risk
(a
form
of
credit
risk)
and
reinvestment
risk
(a
form
of
interest
rate
or
market
risk).
Securitization
The
process
and
the
result
of
pooling
financial
assets
together
and
issuing
liability
and
equity
obligations
backed
by
the
resulting
pool
of
assets
to
convert
those
assets
into
marketable
securities.
The
underlying
assets
are
usually,
but
always,
non-marketable
by
themselves.
Any
type
of
financial
asset
can
be
securitized.
Securitized
mortgage
obligations
may
be
called
mortgage
backed
securities
or
collateralized
mortgage
obligations.
Securitized
non-mortgage
assets
are
typically
called
asset
backed
securities
however
the
term
collateralized
debt
obligation
is
increasingly
used
to
refer
to
securitized
corporate
debts.

loan
or
groups
of
similar
loans
may
be
securitized.
Loans
to
be
securitized
must
usually
be
underwritten
with
terms
and
documents
that
conform
to
wholesale
market
standards.
For
some
securitizations,
additional
credit
support,
called
credit
enhancement,
may
be
obtained
through
insurance,
a
letter
of
credit,
over
collateralization
or
other
means.
Many
securitizations
use
multi-tranche
structures
that
allocate
the
principal
and
interest
cash
flows
from
the
underlying
assets
in
patterns
that
create
higher
and
lower
risk
securities.

Security
agreement
An
agreement
between
one
or
more
debtors
and
one
or
more
creditors
in
which
the
debtor
grants
the
creditor
an
interest
in
the
debtor’s
personal
property
as
collateral
for
the
debt.
(Alternatively
or
in
addition,
the
collateral
may
be
property
owned
by
a
guarantor
or
by
another
third
party.)
As
used
in
Article
9
of
the
Uniform
Commercial
Code,
it
is
an
agreement
that:
is
in
writing;
gives
the
names
of
the
parties;
is
signed
or
authenticated
by
the
debtor;
describes

is
granting
or
giving
the
security
interest
in
the
collateral
to
the

While
the

Self-assessment
A
risk
evaluation
approach.
A
subjective
process
of
identifying
risks,
assessing
the
likelihood
that
they
will
occur
and
estimating
the
impact
if
they
do
occur.
Although
self
assessment
can
be
applied
to
any
risk,
it
is
primarily
applied
to
operations
risk
-
especially
for
the
quantification
of
operations
risk
under
Basel
II
guidelines.
Self
assessment
is
a
major
element
in
COSO.

Senior
debt
Obligations
of
an
issuer
for
which
repayment
has
contractually
been
given
a
priority
that
is
higher
than
the
repayment
priority
of
other
debts
of
the
same
obligor.
This
arrangement
may
arise
from
either
a
specific
subordination
agreement
or
a
public
issuance
of
subordinated

Sensitivity
test
Sensitivity
analysis
A
single
variant
test
to
see
how
dependent
a
forecast,
projection
or
stress
test
outcome
is
upon
a
single,
selected
variable
or
assumption.
For
example,
a
bank
AL
manager
might
perform
a
sensitivity
analysis
by
examining
a
range
of
rate
risk
forecasts
where
the
only
difference
in
the
forecast
generation
is
a
range
of
possible
values
for
savings
account
maturities.
In
that
example,
the
AL
manager
would
be
able
to
see
how
sensitive
the
projected
rate
risk
exposure
is
to
changes
in
the
savings
maturity
assumption.
Sequential-pay
REMIC
The
most
basic,
simplest
REMIC
structure.
All
investors
owning
a
sequential-pay
REMIC
receive
interest
payments;
however,
the
principal
received
from
the
underlying
mortgages
is
directed
to
repay
each
tranche,
one
at
a
time,
in
a
predetermined
order.
Serial
bond
A
bond
that
provides
for
the
amount
of
debt
to
be
divided
into
a
series
of
different
staggered
maturities.
For
example,
instead
of
issuing$10
million
of
15-year
bonds,
a
municipality
may
issue
$10
million
with
$1
million
maturing
each
year
from
the
year
6
to
the
year
15.
By
issuing
debt
in
serial
form,
the
municipal
issuer
can
match
its
need
to
redeem
maturing
debts
to
its
cash
flow.
This
form
also
enables
the
issuer
to
save
money
since
the
shorter-term
bonds
carry
a
lower
interest
cost
than
longer-term
debt.
Servicing
The
collection
of
principal,
interest,
and
sometimes
property
taxes
from
borrowers;
accounting
for
the
cash
flows
due
and
the
cash
flows
received;
and
remitting
the
cash
flows
to
the
entitled
recipients.
Servicing
spread
A
percentage
of
a
loan’s
or
security’s
principal
amount
that
is
paid
to
a
third
party
as
compensation
for
servicing.
For
example,
in
a
mortgage
pass-through
security,
the
interest
paid
to
the
investors
is
typically
one-half
percent
less
than
the
weighted
average
coupon
rate
paid
by
the
underlying
borrowers.
In
that
example,
the
one-half
percent
difference
is
the
servicing
spread.

date)
and
the
date
that
the
security
and
the
payment
actually
change
hands
(the
settlement
date).
See
net

regular
way
settlement.
(2)

Shiftability
theory
of
liquidity
An
explanation
of
bank
liquidity
that
holds
that
a
bank’s
capacity
to
meet
liquidity
demands
is
related
to
the
volume
of
its
assets
that
can
be
readily
shifted
to
another
bank.
Shareholder
value
added
(SVA)
A
financial
performance
metric
that
attempts
to
measure
the
benefit
created
for
a
firm's
capital
holders.
It
is
expressed
in
dollar
terms
for
a
period
-
not
as
a
percentage
return
ratio.
SVA
is
an
adjusted
value
for
after-tax
earnings,
for
a
period
of
time,
minus
the
opportunity
cost
associated
with
the
firm's
capital.
The
net
of
those
quantities
is
a
measure
of
the
surplus
or
additional
value
provided
to
the
shareholders
as
a
result
of
the
firm's
activities.
The
adjustments
made
to
the
reported
amount
of
after-tax
earnings
are
intended
to
remove
distortions
resulting
from
accrual
accounting.
For
example,
provisions
for
bad
debts
are
usually
added
back
to
income
and
actual
losses
from
bad
debts
are
subtracted
instead.
Cash
taxes
are
used
instead
of
book
taxes.
One
of
the
main
attractions
of
this
performance
metric
is
that
fact
that,
unlike
measure
of
return
on
market
value,
it
can
be
applied
to
segments
within
a
firm.
Accordingly,
it
is
primarily
used
by
managers
to
evaluate
the
performance
of
divisions
or
branches.
Some
users
apply
SVA
down
to
the
account
manager
or
customer
level.
The
phrase
"shareholder
value
added"
is
favored
because
the
phrase
"economic
value
added"
is
marked.
See
value
based
management.
Short
(1)
noun
—
The
position
of
an
investor
who
sells,
or
commits
to
sell,
a
security
in
either
the
cash
or
futures
markets.
For
example,
the
sale
of
an
interest
rate
future
is
a
commitment
to
deliver
securities
at
some
future
date
in
exchange
for
an
agreed-upon
amount.
This
is
called
a
short
futures
position.
(2)
verb
—
The
act
of
selling
or
committing
to
sell
in
the
future.
Short
sale
The
sale
of
security
that
is
not
owned
by
the
seller.
The
seller
borrows
the
security,
sells
it,
and
then
buys
it
at
a
later
date
to
return
it
to
the
lender.
The
purpose
of
a
short
sale
is
to
attempt
to
profit
from
the
fall
in
the
price
of
a
security.
Short
sales
are
considered
trading
activities.
For
banks,
when
the
security
that
is
sold
is
"borrowed"
from
the
seller's
investment
portfolio,
the
transaction
is
not
considered
a
short
sale;
it
must
be
treated
as
an
outright
sale
of
the
underlying
security.

Single
monthly
mortality
rate
(SMM)
A
measure
of
the
amount
of
monthly
principal
reduction
in
excess
of
the
scheduled
monthly
principal
payment.
The
SMM
is
simply
the
amount
of
prepaid
principal

month
expressed
as
a
percentage
of
the
principal
balance
at
the
beginning
of
the
month.
It
is
not
commonly
quoted;
however,
an
annualized
SMM,
called
the
constant
prepayment
rate
or
CPR,
is
commonly
quoted.
Single-payment

Smoothing
Also

continuous
yield
curves
by
connecting
the
dots
between
observed.
If,
for
example,
we
have
observed
rates
for
1,
2,
3,
5
and
10
year
maturities,
smoothing
is
the
technique
used
to
infer
rates
for
all
maturities
between
those
known
points.
The
known
points
are
called
"knot

The
simplest
smoothing
technique
is
"linear

For
forward
rates,
the

Soft
call
protection
(for
convertible
bonds)
One
of
two
types
of
call
protection.
Soft
or
provisional
call
protection
prohibits
an
issuer
from
calling
a
bond
issue
until
a
certain
threshold
price
level
for
the
underlying
stock
has
been
reached.
For
example,
the
bond
structure
might
specify
that
the
bonds
may
be
called
when
the
closing
price
of
the
underlying
stock
is
at
least
120-150
percent
of
the
conversion
price
for
any
20
out
of
30
consecutive
trading
days.
Soft
call
provisions
will
be
in
effect
for
two
to
three
years
after
hard
call
protection
has
expired.
Soft
call
protection
is
a
compromise
between
issuers
and
investors.
It
guarantees
that
the
issuing
company
will
not
be
able
to
call
the
bonds
until
the
investors
have
achieved
a
certain
level
of
profitability,
but
it
also
provides
issuers
with
more
flexibility
than
that
available
from
hard
call
protection
and
allows
the
company

Solvency
The
condition
of
having
sufficient
funds
to
cover
losses.
In
the
short
term,
solvency
is
a
manifestation
of
liquidity.
Fundamentally,
however,
solvency
is
a
function
of
capital
adequacy.
See
insolvency.
Solvency
risk
The
risk
of
not
being
able
to
cover
losses
regardless
of
the
source,
type,
or
size
of
the
losses.
In
a
broad
sense,
solvency
is
often
equated
with
liquidity
risk
since
ready
money
is
needed
to
cover
losses.
However,
it
is
more
accurate
to
say
that
the
ultimate
source
of
funds
available
to
cover
losses
is
capital.
Therefore,
solvency
risk
is
the
risk
that
the
bank
will
default.
Ultimately,
it
is
the
risk
of
bank
failure.
Spec
An
informal
lender's
term
for
real
estate
projects
that
are
built
in
anticipation
of
finding
tenants;
the
term
"spec"
is
lender
slang
for
speculative.
Special
assessment
bonds
or
notes
Municipal
securities
repaid
from
taxes
that
are
imposed
only
on
the
individuals
who
are
considered
to
directly
benefit
from
public
improvements
made
to
a
neighborhood
or
community
within
the
municipality.
The
most
common
examples
are
school

special
purpose
entity
(SPE)
special
purpose
vehicle
(SPV)
A
legal
entity,
sometimes
a
trust
or
a
limited
partnership,
that
is
created
solely
for
the
purpose
of
holding
assets.
(1)
The
SPV
may
be
used
to
obtain
"off
balance
sheet
funding"
by
obtaining
secured
loans
backed
by
its
assets.
GAAP
accounting
rules
may
permit
the
assets
and
liabilities
of
the
SPV
to
be
unconsolidated
and
therefore
off
the
balance
sheet
of
the
entity
that
generated
the
assets.
(2)
The
SPV
may
issue
securities
backed
by
its
assets.
In
a
typical
collateralized
debt
obligation,
the
underlying
assets
are
owned
by
a
special
purpose
vehicle.
The
SPV
then
issues
different
classes
of
securities
with
different
risk
characteristics.
Note
that
the
term
"CDO"
may
be
used
to
refer
to
the
SPV
or
to
the
securities
that
are
issued
by
the
SPV.
Special
tax
bonds
or
notes
Municipal
securities
that
are
repaid
solely
from
specific
taxes.
These
taxes
are
typically
excise
taxes
imposed
upon
purchases
of
items
such
as
gasoline,
tobacco
products,
or
liquor.
Only
the
revenue
collected
from
that
specific
tax
is
available
to
pay
interest
and
principal
due
for
the
securities.
Speed
The
rate
at
which
an
MBS
prepays.
An
MBS
with
little
or
no
prepayments
is
said
to
have
a
slow
speed.
An
MBS
with
significant
prepayments
is
said
to
have
a
high
speed
or
to
be
speeding.
Since
pools
that
prepay
faster
than
anticipated
can
perform
much
worse
than
investors
hoped,
investors
only
half
jokingly
say
that
speed
kills.
See
CPR,
prepayment
estimate
and
PSA
for
information
about
measures
of
speed.
Split-term
amortization
An
amortization
schedule
that
has
periodic
payments
inconsistent
with
the
maturity
date
of
the
debt.
For
example,
a
5/10
amortization
schedule
requires
payments
just
large
enough
to
fully
amortize
the
debt
in
10
years
together
with
a
final
maturity
date
only
5
years
in
the
future.
Split-term
amortization
schedules
result
in
balloon
payments
at
maturity.

Spread
(1)
noun
—
The
difference
between
two
prices
or
two
rates.
Different
users
have
many
different
and
highly
specific
usages
of
this
term.
For
example,
traders
use
spread
to
mean
the
difference
between
bid
and
asked
prices
for
a
security.
Underwriters
use
spread
to
mean
the
difference
between
the
price
realized
by
the
issuer
and
the
price
paid
by
the
investor.
Bank
analysts
use
spread
to
mean
the
difference
between
the
average
rate
paid
on
a
bank’s
assets
and
the
average
rate
paid
on
the
bank’s
liabilities.
(In
connection
with
the
use
of
the
term
spread
by
bank
analysts,
see
net
interest
margin.
In
ALM,
when
spread
is
used
as
a
noun
it
most
often
refers
to
the
difference
between
two
rates
or
yields.
(2)
noun
—
Financial
analysts,
credit
analysts,
and
lenders
use
the
term
spread
to
refer
to
a
financial
statement
that
has
been
converted
to
a
standard
format
for
purposes
of
analysis
or
comparison.
(3)
verb
—
In
ALM,
most
often
means
the
disaggregation
of
a
quantity.
For
example,
the
total
amount
of
certificates
of
deposit
on
a
bank’s
balance
sheet
may
be
spread
into
different

Spread
lock
A
contract
that
guarantees
the

swap
at
a
predetermined
rate
above
some

Spread-over
Treasuries
The
difference
between
the
bond
equivalent
yield
for
any
investment
and
the
bond
equivalent
yield
for
a
Treasury
investment
with
the
same
maturity.
Comparisons
of
the
returns
for
most
fixed-income
investments
are
typically
made
using
spread
over
Treasury
values.
Investments
of
the
same
type
but
different
maturities
as
well
as
different
types
of
investments
can
be
readily
compared
in
this
manner.
For
example,
one
MBS
may
offer
a
bond
equivalent
yield
that
is
20
basis
points
above
Treasury
yields
while
another
may
offer
a
40
basis
point
spread.

not
only
the
described

indebtedness
of
the

Spreads
and
spreading
Bankers
almost
always
change
the
format
of
the
borrower's
financial
statements
to
a
standard
format
used
by
the
bank
in
order
to
facilitate
both
analysis
and
comparisons.
The
process
of
restating
the
format
is
usually
called
spreading
and
the
reformatted
reports
are
often
called

institution
contemplating
the
extension
of

Stage
payments
Advances
made
under
construction
loans
when
the
loan
proceeds
are
disbursed
only
as
specific
construction
tasks
are
completed.
For
example,
a
portion
of
the
loan
proceeds
may
be
disbursed
after
the
foundation
is
poured.
Construction
lenders
often
disperse
funds
in
4
or
5
stages;
however,
as
many
as
10
stages
are
common.
Standard
deviation
A
statistical
measure
of
the
extent
to
which
measurements
vary
from
their
mean.
A
quantification
of
the
dispersion
for
a
set
of
data.
For
example,
if
the
high
temperature
each
day
in
one
four-day
period
was
70
degrees,
71
degrees,
69
degrees,
and
70
degrees,
that
four-day
period
has
a
mean
(average)
high
temperature
of
70
degrees.
A
second
four-day
period
might
have
high
temperatures
of
70
degrees,
60
degrees,
80
degrees,
and
70
degrees.
That
second
period
also
has
an
average
high
temperature
of
70
degrees.
Even
though
both
four-day
periods
had
the
same
average
high
temperature,
they
were
quite
different.
In
the
first
period,
the
standard
deviation
is
quite
small.
There
is
little
dispersion.
In
the
second
period,
the
standard
deviation
is
much
larger.
Standard
mortgagee
clause
A
provision
in
a
hazard
insurance
contract
stipulating
that
in
the
event
of
a
loss,
proceeds
will
be
paid
to
a
secured
party.
Usually
used
when
the
insured
property
is
real
property.
Includes
personal
property
that
is
insured
as
contents
of
the
insured
real
property.
Sometimes
referred
to
as
simply
a
mortgagee
clause,
the
standard
mortgagee
clause
is
actually
a
much
broader,
stronger
type
of
insurance
policy
stipulation.
Under
the
standard
mortgagee
clause,
the
secured
party
is
protected
against
any
act
or
neglect
of
the
insured
that
may
otherwise
invalidate
the
policy
for
the
owner.
For
example,
if
an
insured
burns
down
his
insured
property,
his
arson
may
void
his
insurance
coverage,
but
it
does
not
invalidate
the
insurance
protection
provided
to
his
secured
lender.
Sometimes
called
a
New
York
mortgagee
clause.
See
mortgagee
clause.

Statement
of
financial
accounting
standards

issued
by
the
Financial
Standards
Accounting
Board
(FASB)
covering
a
particular
topic.
Usually,
these
statements
are
referenced
with
the
acronym
FAS
followed
by
the
numeral
for
a
specific
statement.
For
example,
FAS

Statement
savings
account
A
savings
account
which
does
not
provide
the
depositor
with
a

Instead,
the
depositor
receives
a
monthly
or

statement
from
the
bank.
Static
gap
analysis
Gap
analysis
method
that
measures
exposure
to
interest
rate
risk
based
solely
upon
the
assets
and
liabilities
held
by
the
bank
at
the
time
that
the
analysis
is
performed.
The
opposite
of
dynamic
gap
analysis.
Static
spread
(1)
The
difference
between
two
values
at
a
single
point
in
time.
For
example,
the
difference
between
two
yields.
(2)
The
calculated
spread
over
the
Treasury
yield
that
the
investor
would
realize
from
all
of
the
cash
flows
produced
by
his
investment
if
it
is
held
to
maturity.
Those
cash
flows
are
each
compared
to
the
Treasury
spot
rate
curve.
Because
the
cash
flows
from
a
security
are
each
compared
to
the
Treasury
yield
curve,
the
static
spread
is
a
spread
over
the
entire
curve.
Each
of
the
cash
flows
from
a
bond
is
discounted
to
a
present
value
using
the
spot
Treasury
rate
with
the
same
maturity
as
the
cash
flow.
Those
present
values
are
then
totaled.
The
static
spread
amount
must
be
added
to
the
discount
rates
obtained
from
the
Treasury
spot
curve
so
that
the
sum
of
the
discounted
cash
flows
equals
the
bond's
price.
Statutory
lien
A
lien
created
by
either
federal
or
state
legislatures
or
through
court
rulings.
For
example,
a
lien
that
banks
are
given
against
a
borrower’s
deposits.

Step-ups
A

rate
increases
if
the

is
not
called.
Sticky
(1)
A
term
used
by
economists
to
describe
changes
in
dependent
variables
that
tend
to
lag
behind
changes
in
the
independent
variables
with
which
they
are
associated.
For
example,
time
lags
are
known
to
exist
between
changes
in
prevailing
interest
rates
and
changes
in
the
rates
offered
on
bank
core
deposit
products.
But
they
are
sticky.
Almost
all
banks

Street
A
colloquial
expression
used
to
describe
Wall
Street
investors
or
the
community
of
dealers.
For
example,
the
street
consensus
of
prepayment
speeds
is
the
average
forecast
of
prepayment
speeds
from
major
mortgage-backed

Stress
test
A
multivariate
test
of
a
specific
scenario
at
a
specific
stress
level.
Not
to
be

Stress
scenario
Usually
called
stress
testing
but
also
known
as
stress
analysis
or
stress
scenario
analysis.
Modeling
a
series
of
unusual,
hypothetical
events
or
scenarios.
Stress
tests
may
model
the
impact
of
extreme
market
conditions,
or
they
may
model
the
change
in
the
measured
amount
of
value
at
risk
(VAR)
that
occurs
when
simulation
assumptions
are
pushed
to
extremes.
For
example,
stress
tests
for
correlation
measures
of
VAR
include
simulations
in
which
the
correlations
are
assumed
to
change
dramatically.

Stressed
PAC
A
planned
amortization
class
(PAC)
CMO
tranche
in
a
CMO
experiencing
rapid
prepayments
of
underlying
collateral.
The
PAC
tranche
is
still
performing
within
expected
ranges,
(i.e.,
it
is
not
a
busted

are
under
strain.
A
stressed
PAC
will
become

Stripped
mortgage-backed
securities
(SMBSs)
Mortgage
securities
that
separate
principal
and
interest
payments
from
the
underlying
mortgage-backed
securities.
SMBSs
can
take
four
forms:
interest-only
strips,
called
I/O
strips;
principal-only
strips,
called
P/O
strips;
discount
strips;
and
premium
strips.
I/O
and
P/O
strips
are
the
more
common
of
the
four.
Today,
REMIC
CMOs
are
used
far
more
frequently
than
SMBSs
to
create
securities
with
the
same
cash
flow
characteristics.
Strips
Principal
and
interest
cash
flows
due
from
any
interest-bearing
securities
can
be
separated
into
different
financial
instruments.
This
is
done
by
stripping
each
coupon
payment
from
the
underlying
investment
to
create
a
separate
security.
For
example,
a
5-year
note
can
be
separated
into
11
pieces:
10
semiannual
coupon
payments
and
the
final
principal
payment.
Each
of
these
11
pieces
is
a
separate
cash
flow
that
can
be
purchased
or
sold
just
like
a
Treasury
bill.
The
cash
flows
are
sold
at
a
discount.
The
amount
of
the
discount
and
the
time
until
the
cash
flow
is
paid
determine
the
investor's
return.
Structural
liquidity
A
term
used
to
refer
to
the
liquidity
available
to
a
financial
institution
from
its
current
positions
-
principally
its
unpledged
marketable
assets
and
its
holdings
of
term
liabilities
with
long
remaining
lives.
Structured
finance
A
general
term
used
to
describe
either
the
practice
or
the
result
of
creating
securities
by
repackaging
cash
flows
from
financial
contracts.
Examples
include
MBSs,
CMOs,
ABSs,
and
CDOs.
Structured
notes
The
broad,
regulatory
definition
of
this
term
is
debt
securities
whose
cash
flow
characteristics
(coupon,
redemption
amount,
or
stated
maturity)
depend
upon
one
or
more
indices
and/or
that
have
embedded
forwards
or
options.
For
example,
since
the
early
1990s,
U.S.
government
agencies
have
been
issuing
unsecured
bonds
and
notes
with
coupons
that
are
fixed
for
a
predetermined
time
and
then
increase
or
step
up
to
a
higher
amount
if
the
securities
are
not
called.
Embedded
forwards
and
options
in
the
structure
of
notes
allow
underwriters
to
create
an
unlimited
number
of
risk/reward
profiles
and
to
customize
risk
characteristics
to
fit
an
investor’s
desired
risk
exposure.
By
this
broad
definition,
structured
notes
include
all
CMOs.
However,
the
term
also
includes
a
variety
of
other
securities
that
are
not
necessarily
mortgage
related.
In
fact,
many
structured
notes
are
not
mortgage
backed
and
some
definitions
of
this
term
explicitly
exclude
mortgage-backed
securities.
Sometimes
called
hybrid
securities.
Student

Subordinate
debentures
A
type
of
corporate
bond
for
which
the
indenture
covenants
provide
that
some
of
the
company's
debt
has
a
lower
priority
than
other
debts
in
the
event
of
a
liquidation.
For
example,
some
bonds
may
be
subordinate
to
others.
Subordinate
bonds
are
usually
unsecured.
Unsecured
subordinate
bonds
may
be
referred
to
as
subordinate
debentures.
Subordinate,
subordinated,
subordination
Debts
or
claims
that
have
a
lower
status
or
priority
than
other
debts
or
claims
are
subordinate.
For
example,
creditor
A
may
agree
in
a
subordination
agreement
to
have
its
claims
on
the
cash
flow
or
on
the
assets
of
a
borrower
lower
in
priority
than
(i.e.,
subordinate
to)
the
claims
to
that
cash
flow
or
collateral
by
creditor
B.
In
finance
and
accounting,
the
term
also
refers
to
debts
that
include
provisions
making
them
subordinate
to
other
liabilities.
For
example,
a
bond
issue
may,
by
contractual
agreement,
be
subordinate
to
all
other
bonds
issued
by
a
company.
Subordination
and
attornment
agreements
Documents
used
in
commercial
mortgage
transactions
in
which
the
mortgaged
property
is
leased
by
the
borrower
to
tenants.
The
agreement
is
executed
by
the
tenants
in
favor
of
the
lender.
By
executing
the
agreement,
the
tenant/lessee
agrees
to
subordinate
its
lease
to
the
mortgage
that
the
borrower/lessor
is
granting
to
the
lender.
These
agreements
give
the
lender
more
rights
and
more
flexibility
for
disposing
of
the
property
in
the
event
that
the
borrower
defaults.
Subsidiary
A
separate
corporation
that
is
owned
by
another
corporation.
Subsistence
certificate
A
written
form
prepared
by
a
state
office
or
officer
attesting
to
the
fact
that
a
named
corporation
is
in
good
standing
in
that
state.
Suitability
A
term
used
in
the
securities
industry
to
describe
the
match
between
the
risk
characteristics
of
any
investment
and
the
investment
needs,
risks
awareness
and
risk
appetite
of
any
buyer.
Brokers
and
dealers
have
substantial
legal
and
ethical
responsibility
to
make
sure
that
what
they
sell
is
suitable
for
each
buyer.
Summary
appraisal
report
One
of
three
types
of

appraisal
reports
defined
under
Uniform
Standards
of
Professional
Appraisal
Practice
rules.
A

Super
floater
Floating
rate
CMO
tranches
that
have
coupon
rates
that
are
determined
by
formulas
such
that
the
interest
rate
paid
is
a
multiple
of
an
underlying
rate
minus
a
stated
spread.
For
example,
a
superfloater
may
pay
interest
at
the
rate
of
3
times
1-month
LIBOR
minus
16
percent.
In
this
example,
if
1-month
LIBOR
is
5
percent,
then
the
coupon
rate
for
this
super
floater
might
be
a
negative
1
percent.
However,
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
negative
interest
rates,
super
floaters
often
have
floors.
Super
floaters
are
more
desirable
in
high
or
rising
rate
environments.
Super

Survey
A
precise
physical
determination
of
the
location
and
boundaries
of
real
property.
Surveys
are
performed
by
qualified
experts
called
surveyors.
Survey
findings
are
reflected
in
documents
called
surveys,
survey
reports,
or
certificates
of
survey.
For
unplatted
land,
the
survey
determines
the
location
of
the
property
with
reference
to
known
points.
For
all
land,
the
survey
shows
the
dimensions
of
the
property,
the
location
of
improvements
(such
as
buildings),
and
the
dimensions
of
the
improvements.
Lenders
use
surveys
to
verify
the
legal
description
of
property,
to
verify
that
the
property
discussed
in
appraisal
reports
is
identical
to
the
property
owned
by
the
borrower,
and
to
verify
that
driveways,
terraces,
garden
walls,
and
other
structures
do
not
cross
property
lines.

rate
swap,
one
party
agrees
to
swap
fixed-rate
loan
payments
with
the
floating-rate
payments
of
the
other

Swaption
An
option
to
enter
into
a
swap.
A
payer
or
put
swaption
is
the
option
to
enter
into
a

Sweep
account
A
deposit
account,
usually
at
a
bank,
that
periodically
removes
a
portion
of
the
customer’s
funds
into
a
higher
yielding
instrument.
Bank
sweep
accounts
are
often
sold
as
cash
management
tools.
With
a
bank
sweep
account,
idle
funds
are
swept
each
night
from
a
transaction
account
into
a
higher-yielding,
overnight
investment.
Some
banks
offer
sweep
accounts
that
only
remove
excess
balances
weekly.
Brokerage
firms
offer
sweep
accounts
as
well
with
weekly
or
monthly
sweep
frequencies.

Syndication
An
arrangement
in
which
two
or
more
banks
lend
directly
to
the

Systemic
liquidity
requirements
can
take
a
number

cascade
into
a

Targeted
amortization
class
(TAC)
tranche
Bonds
created
in
scheduled-pay
CMO
structures.
A
TAC
tranche
is
structured
to
avoid
prepayment
volatility.
Each
TAC
has
a
designated
target
speed.
When
prepayments
exceed
the
targeted
speed,
the
excess
cash
flow
is
diverted
to
other
tranches
in
the
CMO.
Unlike
a
planned
amortization
class
(PAC)
tranche,
a
TAC
tranche
is
not
protected
from
extension
risk
if
prepayments
are
slower
than
expected.
For
this
reason,
TACs
can
be
viewed
as
half
PACs.
TACs
offer
investors
protection
(but
not
immunity)
from
call
risk
but
no
protection
from
extension
risk.

Taxable
equivalent
yield
(TEY)
The
yield
that
a
tax-free
investment
would
provide
to
an
investor
if
the
tax-free
yield
was
"grossed
up"
by
the
amount
of
taxes
not
paid.
This
is
the
most
common
way
of
comparing
yields
on
taxable
and
tax-free
investments.
Instead
of
reducing
a
taxable
yield
by
the
amount
of
applicable
taxes
to
compare
it
with
a
tax-free

the
tax-free
yield
is
increased
by
a
hypothetical
amount
of
income

Technical
review
One
of
two
types
of
real
estate
appraisal
reviews.
A
technical
review
is
a
review
performed
by
another
appraiser.
The
primary
purpose
of
the
technical
review
is
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
appraisal
meets
Uniform
Standards
of
Professional
Appraisal
Practice
requirements
and
whether
the
opinions
and
conclusions
in
the
report
are
reasonable.
Technical
reviews
ordinarily
do
not
challenge
the
original
appraiser’s
choice
of
comparables
unless
there
is
an
obvious
problem.

TED

between
U.S.
Treasury
bill
yields
and

for
Euro

The
TED
spread
is
used
as
a
measure
of
investor
confidence.
When
the
spread
is
small,
investors
are
not
requiring
a
large
amount
of
additional
compensation
for
the
additional
risk
of
Euro
deposits.
When
the
spread
is
large,
investors
are
willing
to
give
up
yield
to
obtain
the
higher
quality
of
U.S.
Treasury
bills.
A
sudden

granted
for
a

Term
structure
model
Also
known
as
yield
curve
models.
An
assumption,
or
set
of
assumptions,
used
to
describe
future
changes
in
interest
rates
over
a
range
of
maturities.
The
most
simple
term
structure
model
is
a
parallel
shift
in
rates,
e.g.
all
rates
rise
by
1
percent.
Implied
forward
rates
may
be
the
most
common
term
structure
model.
More
accurate
models
provide
a
systematic
way
to
assume
the
random
movement
of
the
interest
rates
along
the
yield
curve.
These
models
constrain
the
range
of
movement
of
the
rates,
and
the
corresponding
probabilities
such
that
they
are
(i)
internally
consistent,
that
is,
there
is
no
riskless
profitable
arbitrage,
and
(ii)
externally
consistent,
that
is,
the
values
of
certain
securities
implied
from
the
model
agree
with
the
market
values.
The
following
five
term
structure
models
are
the
most
systemic
and
accurate:
Vasicek,
Extended
Vasicek
(Hull
and
White),
Ho
and
Lee,
Heath,
Jarrow
and
Morton
(constant

and
Heath,
Jarrow
and
Morton
(declining
volatility).

invested
principal
plus
interest
income
earned
from
the
successive
reinvestment
of
previously
earned
interest
on
that
investment
is
combined
with
projected
capital
gains
or
losses.
Total
return
differs
from
yield-to-maturity
first
because
it
can
include
gains
or
losses
from
sales
prior
to
maturity
and
second
because
it
permits
the
assumption
of
a
reinvestment
rate
different
from
the
yield
earned
on
the
underlying
principal.
Total
return
swaps
A
type
of
credit
derivative
instrument.
Swap
contracts
in
which
the
protection
buyer
sells
the
total
return
from
a
particular
reference
asset
such
as
a
corporate
loan
or
bond.
In
exchange,
the
protection
buyer
receives
a
rate
of
interest
such
as
LIBOR.
Alternatively,
the
protection
buyer
may
agree
to
receive
the
total
return
from
a
different
reference
asset.
(In
the
first
case,
the
protection
buyer
has
reduced
credit
risk
by
taking
a
rate
such
as
LIBOR
and
giving
up
the
cash
flow
from
a
reference
asset
with
credit
risk.
In
the
second
case,
the
protection
buyer
is
diversifying
credit
risk
by
exchanging
the
risk
from
one
obligor
for
the
risk
for
another
obligor.)
Note
that
in
a
total
return
swap,
the
support
seller
is
guaranteeing
not
just
against
default
by
the
reference
obligor
but
also
against
the
deterioration
in
the
credit
quality
of
the
reference
obligor
even
if
there
is
no
default.
"Total
return"
includes
interest
payments
and
changes
in
the
market
value
of
the
reference
asset.
As
a
result,
the
total
return
of
a
credit
asset
can
be
affected
by
various
factors,
some
of
which
may
be
quite
extraneous
to
the
asset
in
question,
such
as
interest
rate
movements,
exchange
rate
fluctuations
etc.
Also
known
as
a
total
rate
of
return
swap
or
TROR
swap.
Total
risk-based
capital

Trading
(1)
The
activity
of
buying
and
selling
financial
instruments
or
commodities
for
profit.
Individuals
or
entities
may
engage
in
trading
either
strictly
on
their
own
behalf
or
for
current
or
future
transactions
with
customers.
Trading
profits
may
come
from
market
price
changes
but
may
also
come
from
the
spreads
between
bid
and
asked
prices
or
from
customer
markups.
Trading
is
distinct
from
investing,
although
trading
activities
are
not
always
easy
to
distinguish
from
investing
activities.
In
trading,
the
profit
goal
is
almost
always
short
term.
Unlike
trading,
investing
is
generally
longer
term
and
may
even
include
the
intent
to
hold
the
instrument
to
maturity.
A
common
misconception
is
that
trading
activities
are
speculative
while
investing
activities
are
not.
Trading
may
indeed
include
highly
speculative
transactions.
However,
trading
may
also
include
relatively
low-risk
transactions
such
as
matched
trading
or
arbitrage.
Like
investing,
trading
may
involve
either
cash
or
derivative
instruments.
Trading
transactions
may
involve
cash
and/or
futures
positions.

One
of
three
defined
categories

in
FAS
115
for
the
classification
of
financial
instruments
held
as
assets
on
the
books
of
an
investor.
Trading
securities
are
those
owned
by
investors
engaged
in
trading
activities
including
short-term
speculation.
Under
FAS
115,
trading
assets
must
be
reported
at
their
market
values.
FAS
115
also
includes
provisions
that
restrict
investors’
ability
to
transfer
assets
from
the
trading
category
to

Tranche
A
segment
or
tier
within
a
loan
or
security.
Also
known
as
a
class.
For
example,
collateralized
mortgage
obligations
(CMOs)
are
securities
for
which
the
cash
flows
are
segregated
into
tranches
and
sold
separately.
Each
tranche
is
a
separate
security
with
its
own
maturity
date
and
interest
rate.
CMOs
may
have
over
a
hundred
tranches
or
classes.
Tranche
is
the
French
word
for
slice.
Tranches
are
used
to
reallocate
principal
and
interest
cash
flows
so
that
some
classes
have
lower
risk
while
some
have
higher
risk.
See

Transaction
risk
One
of
nine
risks
defined
by
the

the
Currency.
The
risk
to
earnings
or
capital
arising
from
problems
with
service
or
product
delivery.
The
Federal
Reserve
and
most

refer
to
this
risk
as
operations
or
operational

Transition
asset
An
off-balance
sheet
asset
created
under
FAS
87
rules
when
pension
plan
assets
exceed
the
projected
benefit
obligation
(PBO)
at
the
date
that
FAS
87
rules
are
implemented.
The
amount
of
the
off-balance
sheet
asset
is
the
amount
of
the

This
asset
is
amortized
-
usually
over
the
projected
remaining
service
lives
for
employees
expected
to
receive
benefits.
The
amortization
reduces
the
reported
benefit
expense
of
the
sponsoring
firm.
The
unamortized
remaining
balance
of
the

True
consignment
A
transaction
in
which
a
person
delivers
goods

a
merchant
for
the
purpose
of
sale,
and
the
merchant
deals
in

True
lease
A
legal
term
for
a
transaction
that
is
intended

term
meaning
the
simple
interest
yield

less.
In
calculating
true
yield,
the
actual
number
of
days
in
the
year
(365)
is
divided
by
the
actual
number
of
days
that
the
investment
income
is
earned.
Truth-in-Lending
Act
A
Federal
statute
that
governs
a
number
of
practices
related
to
bank
loans
-
especially,
but
not
only,
consumer
loans.
The
Federal
Reserve
Board
of
Governors
has
adopted
Regulation
Z
to
implement
this
statute.
The
regulation
has
specific
requirements
giving
some
borrowers
the
right
to
rescind
certain
loans
and
very
specific
requirements
about
how
banks
must
disclose
rescission
rights.
The
regulation
also
includes
very
detailed
requirements
for
calculating
and
disclosing
annual
percentage
rates
for
many
loans.
See
annual
percentage
rate
and
rescission.
Turnover
or
turns
Terms
used
to
describe
the
number
of
operating
cycles
in
a
defined
period
of
time
or
the
length
of
each
specific
operating
cycle.
Typical
turnover
cycles
are:
the
rate
at
which
accounts
receivable
converts
to
cash,
the
rate
at
which
inventory
converts
to
receivables
or
cash,
the
rate
at
which
accounts
payable
are
paid,
and
the
number
of
times
in
a
year
inventory
can
be
said
to
be
sold
and
replaced.
For
example,
if
a
firm's
average
inventory
level
is
equivalent
to
one
quarter
of
its
annual
sales,
it
can
be
said
that
inventory
turns
four
times
a
year.
(See
days
inventory,
days
payables
and
days
receivables
for
definitions
of
other
common
measurements
of
turnover.)
While
turnover
concepts
are
most
often
applied
to
elements
of
the
working
capital
conversion
cycle,
there
are
other
applications.
For
example,
asset
turnover
is
the
ratio
of
net
sales
divided
by
total
assets.
12b-1
fee
A
type
of
fee
charged
to
investors
in
some
mutual
funds.
In
theory,
the
fee
is
supposed
to
reimburse
the
sponsor
for
sales,
distribution,
or
shareholder
liaison
expenses.
In
reality,
however,
it
is
another
type
of
administrative
or
management
fee.

Unrecognized
net
gain
or
unrecognized
net
loss
An
off-balance
sheet
asset
or
liability
created
under
FAS
87
rules
when
plan
assets
in
a
defined
benefit
pension
plan
exceed
or
fall
short
of
the
projected
benefit
obligation
(PBO).
The
gain
or
loss
is
usually
caused
by
actual
investment
returns
for
plan
assets
that
exceed
or
fall
short
of
expected
or
assumed
rates
of
return.
Gains
or
losses
may
also
result
from
changes
in
actuarial
assumptions.
These
are
off-balance
sheet
assets
or
liabilities
because
volatile
returns
on
plan
assets
realized
in
subsequent
periods
can
reduce
or
completely
offset
the
unrealized
gains
or
losses
that
previously
existed.
These
gains
or
losses
are
from
changes
in
the
plan
or
the
plan
assets
that
occur
subsequent
to
the
adoption
of
FAS
87
rules
and
should
not
be
confused
with
initial
transition
assets,
unrecognized
transition
assets,
initial
transition
obligations,
or
unrecognized
transition
obligations.
The
amount
of
any
unrecognized
gains
or
losses
is
disclosed
in
a
footnote
to
the
financial
statements.
Unrecognized
prior
service
costs
The
current
unamortized
balance,

date,
of
the
off-balance
sheet
liability
for
prior
service
costs
in
a

pension
plan.

Act
of
1970
(BSA).
The
statute
contains
strong
measures
to
prevent,
detect,
and
prosecute
terrorism
and
international
money
laundering.
The
Act
is
far-reaching
in
scope,
covering
a
broad
range
of
financial
activities
and

Value
at
risk
(VAR)
The
amount
or
percentage
of
value
that
is
at
risk
of
being
lost
from
a
change
in
prevailing
interest
rates
(similarly
defined
for
things
other
than
interest
rates
as
well).
The
sensitivity
of
the
value
of
a
single
financial
instrument,
a
portfolio
of
financial
instruments,
or
an
entire
entity’s
balance
sheet
to
changes
in
interest
rates
can
be
calculated.
The
resulting
sensitivity
is
the
amount
of
value
at
risk.
See
earnings

risk
for
an
alternative
measure
of

value
at
risk
or
EVAR,
can
be
calculated
by
at
least
four
different
mathematical
expresions.
The
simplest
and
least
accurate
measure
of
VAR
is
the
difference
between
the
calculated
economic
value
of

insurance
very
similar
to
whole
life
insurance.
In
a
variable
life
insurance
policy,
the
cash
value
is
invested
in
equity
or
debt
securities.
Policyholders
can
select
and
switch
investment
instruments.
The
policyholder
bears
the
risk
of
the
securities
investment;
the
insurance
company
only
guarantees
a
minimum
death
benefit
amount.
Variable-rate
mortgage
A
less
common
name
for
an
adjustable-rate
mortgage
(ARM).
Variance
Statistical
term
that
quantifies
the
dispersion
of
data
such
as
rates
or
prices
around
the
mean.
For
example,
highly
volatile
rates
are
rates
that
are
sometimes
high
above
the
mean
and
sometimes
way
below
the
mean.
Less
volatile
rates
are
dispersed
closer
to
the
mean
and
therefore
have
smaller
variances.
Similar
to,
but
not
the
same
as,
the
average
amount
by
which
data
deviates
from
the
mean
for
that
data.
Variance
swap
A
swap
agreement
where
one
party
agrees
to
receive
implied
volatility
and
pay
realized
while
the
counterparty
agrees
to
receive
realized
volatility
and
pay
implied.
Vector
path
A
series
of
prepayment
speeds,
in
a
sequence,
that
is
chosen
to
reflect
an
assumed
interest
rate
scenario.
For
example,
if
prevailing
interest
rates
are
near
a
cyclical
low
and
still
falling,
a
selected
vector
path
might
project
a
rate
path
that
assumes
steady
or
falling
rates
in
the
short
run
but
rising
rates
for
a
year
or
more
thereafter.
A
way
of
modeling
future
MBS
performance
with
more
complex
assumptions
than
the
customary
single
estimate
of
future
prepayment
speed.
Vega
The
change
in
an
option’s
price
resulting
from
changes
in
the
volatility
of
the

for
the
underlying.
Vested
accumulated
benefit
obligation
The
portion
of
the
accumulated

obligation
under
a
defined
benefit
plan
to
which
the
employees
have
a

of
implied
volatility
published
by
the
CBOE.
Volatility
The
rate
of
change
in
a
variable.
More
formally,
a
statistical
term
to
quantify
the
dispersion
of
variables
such
as
rates
or
prices
around
the
mean.
A
measure
of
the
variability
of
the
price
of
an
underlying
financial
instrument,
rate,
commodity,
or
currency.
Volatility
only
measures
the
quantity
of
the
change
-
not
the
direction.
Volatility
is
not
influenced
by
the
direction
of
the
change;
it
does
not
matter
whether
the
price
rises
or
falls.
Volatility
is
often
used
as
a
proxy
for
riskiness.

one
or
more
conditions
attached
to
the
granting
of

—
conditions
that
would,
in
the

Warehouse
financing
A
form
of
inventory
financing
in
which
goods
are
held
in
trust
as
collateral
for
the
loan.
Warehouse
financing
may
involve
the
use
of
public
warehouses
in
which
the
goods
are
held
in
locations
owned
by
third
parties.
Alternatively,
warehouse
financing
may
involve
the
use
of
field
warehouses
in
which
the
goods
are
located
on
the
borrower's
premises
but
are
controlled
by
an
independent
third
party.
Warehouse
lines
of
credit
An
informal
name
used
by
some
bankers
for
lines
of
credit
used
to
finance
a
borrower's
temporary
ownership
of
long-term
assets
such
as
mortgages.
Warehouse
receipt
Written
evidence
of
goods
held
in
a
warehouse
operated
by
a
third
party.
The
goods
may
be
in
a
public
(i.e.,
general),
private,
or
field
warehouse.
Also
known
as
collateral
receipts.
The
receipts
may
be
negotiable
or
non-negotiable.
Negotiable
warehouse
receipts
are
bearer
instruments.
A
negotiable
warehouse
receipt
can
be
sold
to
a
buyer
who
then
owns
the
inventory
covered
by
the
receipt.
Warrant
(1)
An
order
drawn
by
a
payor
directing
its
treasurer
to
pay
a
specified
amount
to
the
person
named
or
to
the
bearer.
It
may
be
payable
upon
demand,
in
which
case
it
usually
circulates
in
the
same
way
as
a
bank
check;
or
it
may
be
payable
only
out
of
certain
revenue
when
and
if
received,
in
which
case
it
does
not
circulate
as
freely.
(2)
A
financial
instrument
that
gives
the
holder
the
right,
but
not
the
obligation,
to
purchase
a
specified
amount
of
an
asset
at
a
specified
price
during
a
specified
period
of
time.
A
warrant
may
give
its
holder
the
right
to
buy
shares
of
stock,
bonds,
currencies,
or
commodities.
The
major
difference
between
warrants
and
options
is
that
prices
for
warrants
are
usually
published
with
lists
of
the
prices
for
the
underlying
assets.
Warranty
deed
A
document
that
transfers
title
to
real
estate
from
a
grantor
to
a
grantee.
The
distinguishing
characteristic
of
a
warranty
deed
is
that
it
guarantees
the
grantor's
right
to
make
such
a
conveyance
and
that
the
grantor's
title
is
free
of
all
liens
and
debts
not
specifically
disclosed.
Waterfall
The
contractual
distribution
of
principal
and
interest
cash
flows
in
a
multi-tranche
security
such
as
an
ABS,
CMO
or
CDO.
The
contractually
specified
allocation
of
cash
to
debt
holders
and
other
parties.
The
priority
of
payments
to
holders
of
different
classes
of

Weighted-average
coupon
(WAC)
The
average
interest
rate
charged
to
mortgage
loan
borrowers
in
an
MBS
pool
weighted
by
the
size
of
each
loan.
Individual
loans
in
an
MBS
pool
will
not
usually
have
the
same
rates
of
interest.
For
example,
FNMA
pools
may
have
mortgages
with
up
to
250
basis
points
spread
between
the
highest-rate
and
the
lowest-rate
loans
in
the
pool.
Investors
must
remember
that
the
WAC
may
change
over
time
as
some
loans
in
the
pool
repay
faster
than
others.
Since
loan
by
loan
information
is
not
available,
investors
must
rely
on
the
original
WAC
throughout
the
life
of
the
pool.
Weighted-average

of
origination
for
each
mortgage
in
a
mortgage

(WAM)
The

of
the
time
remaining
until
the
contractual
maturity
date
for
the
loans
in
an

pool
weighted
by
the
size
of
each
loan.
Expressed
in

When-issued
(WI)
New
securities
issues
announced
by
the
issuer
but
not
yet
sold
or
issued.
Securities
may
be
purchased
or
sold
on
a
when-issued
basis.
Such
trades
are
negotiated
on
a
yield
basis
since
price
cannot
be
determined
until
the
coupon
rate
is
known.
Price
is
usually
calculated
for
delivery
on
the
date
of
issue.
Many
U.S.
Treasury
securities
are
actively
traded
on
a
when-issued
basis.
Some
corporate
and
municipal
issues
are
also
purchased
on
a
when-issued
basis.
Purchasing
or
selling
when-issued
securities
is
a
legitimate
and
acceptable
practice
that
should
not
be
confused
with
the
related
practice
of
when-issued
trading.
When-issued
securities
trading
is
the
practice
of
agreeing
to
buy
an
about-to-be-issued
security
on
or
after
the
announcement
of
an
offering
and
then
selling
the
security
before
the
date
on
which
the
securities
are
issued
and
must
be
paid
for.
Such
transactions
are
regarded
as
trading
activities
by
the
banking
regulators.
Whole
life
insurance
A
form
of
life
insurance
that
applies
part
of
the
premium
payments
to
build
an
investment
or
savings
value
for
the
policy
owner.
The
investment
or
savings
value
is
called
the
cash
surrender
value
of
the
policy.
Whole
loan
pools
Mortgage-backed
securities
not
issued
by
or
guaranteed
by
a
U.S
government
agency
or
U.S.
government
sponsored
enterprise.
The
mortgage
loans
comprising
whole
loan
pools
are
generally
loans
that
do
not
meet
GNMA,
FNMA,
or
FHLMC
requirements.
Whole
loan
pools
may
be
structured
as
fixed-rate
pass-through
securities,
floating-rate
pass-through
securities,
or
CMOs.
Also
known
as
private
pools
or
private
label
pools.
Whole
loans
A
phrase
used
to
describe
mortgage
loans
when
the
owner
of
the

also
owns
the
servicing
rights.
In
other
words,
mortgage
loans
that
have
not
had
the
servicing
separated.

Wire
transfers
One
of
the
two
major
methods
of
electronic
funds
transfer.
Only
the
payer
can
originate
the
remittance.
A
wire
transfer’s
information
format
is
completely
flexible,
but
this
flexibility
adds
significantly
to
the
bank’s
labor
costs
and
results
in
much
higher
fees.
With
recourse
A
lending
expression
that
means
the

that
have
been
acquired
from
an
original
lender
or
lessor
are
guaranteed

Funds
of
a
proprietorship
or
a
partnership
that
are
directly
removed
from
the
firm
by
the
proprietor
or

These
are
distributions
distinct
from
salary,
commission,
bonus,
or
rent
payments
paid
to
proprietors
or

A
lending
expression
that

an
original
lender
with
no
guaranty
from

Working
capital
In
accounting
and
finance,
used
to
describe
the
amount,
if
any,
by
which
a
business's
current
assets
exceed
its
current
liabilities.
Also
used
more
loosely
to
describe
the
funds
a
firm
has
available
to
run
its
day-to-day
business
affairs.
Working
capital
conversion
cycle
An
accounting
and
financial
phrase
used
to
describe
the
dynamics
of
short-term
cash
flows
that
occur
during
the
normal
operations
of
a
business.
The
working
capital
conversion
cycle
is
the
circular
process
of
borrowing
money
first
to
purchase
inventory,
then
to
carry
that
inventory
and
finally
to
carry
the
resulting
accounts
receivable
that
are
the
proceeds
of
the
inventory.
When
the
receivables
are
paid,
the
firm
can
then
use
the
proceeds
to
either
repay
the
borrowing
or
to
start
the
cycle
all
over
again
by
purchasing
new
inventory.
Wraparound
mortgage
A
second
mortgage
that
takes
over
the
first.
The
first
mortgage
loan
is
not
paid
off.
Instead,
the
borrower
makes
payments
to
the
second
mortgage
lender
for
the
debt
service
of
both
the
first
and
second
liens.
The
second
lien
holder
then
makes
the
payments
to
the
first
lien
holder.
This
type
of
mortgage
is
used
when
the
borrower
is
unwilling
or
unable
to
refinance
the
first
mortgage.
Prepayment
of
the
first
mortgage
may
be
prohibited
or
may
be
subject
to
high
penalties.
Alternatively,
the
first
mortgage
may
have
a
very
attractive
fixed
rate
of
interest.
The
wraparound
arrangement
permits
the
borrower
to
leave
the
first
mortgage
intact
while
giving
more
control
to
the
lender
willing
to
make
the
second
mortgage.

Yield
The
annual
return
on
an
investment
expressed
as
a
percentage
on
an
annual
basis.
For
interest-bearing
securities,
the
yield
is
a
function
of
the
rate;
the
purchase
price;
the
income
that
can
be
earned
from
the
reinvestment
of
income
received
prior
to
maturity,
call,
or
sale;
and
the
time
from
purchase
to
maturity,
call,
or
sale.
Different
formulas
or

are
used
to
calculate
yields.

When
a
yield
curve
is
constructed
by
calculating
the
coupon
rates
necessary
for
the
Treasury
obligations
of
various
maturities
to
be
priced
at
par,
it
is
called
a
par
yield
curve.
When
a
yield
curve
is
constructed
using
currently
prevailing
rates
for
instruments
available
for
cash
delivery,
it
is
called
the
spot
curve.
When
a
yield
curve
is
constructed
using
currently
prevailing
rates
for
instruments
to
be
delivered
at
future
dates,
it
is
called
the
forward
yield
curve.
When
a
yield
curve
is
calculated
using
currently
prevailing
rates
for
interestbearing
Treasuriy
securities,
it
may
be
referred
to
as
a
coupon
curve.
When
a
yield
curve
is
calculated
using
currently
prevailing
yields
for
zero
coupon
instruments,
it
is
called
the
zero
coupon
curve.

Yield
curve
risk
The
risk
to
a
holder
of
financial
instruments
that
a
change
in
prevailing
interest
rates
will
not
affect
the
prices
or
yields
of
the
same
instruments
in
exactly
equal
amounts
for
each
available
term.
For
example,
an
increase
in
prevailing
interest
rates
might
raise
3-month
U.S.
Treasury
yields
by
100
basis
points
while
6-month
U.S.
Treasury
yields
go
up
by
only
85
basis
points.
(In
this
example,
the
change
to
the
yield
curve
would
be
described
as
flattening.
If,
instead,
the
6-month
rate
had
risen
by
more
than
the
3-month
rate,
the
change
in
the
yield
curve
would
be
described
as
steepening.)
The
risk
of
a
nonparallel
shift
in
the
yield
curve.
One
of
the
four
primary
components
of
interest
rate
risk.
Sometimes
called
yield
curve
twist
risk,
twist
risk,
or
rotation
risk.
Yield
curve
slope
Yield
curves
also
describe
the
amount
of
difference
between
short-term
and
long-term
rates.
A
yield
curve
that
depicts
the
customary
situation
of
long-term
rates
higher
than
short-term
rates
is
called
an
upward
sloping
or
positively
sloped
yield
curve.
A
yield
curve
depicting
the
less
common
occurrence
of
short-term
rates
higher
than
long-term
rates
is
called
a
downward
sloping,
negatively
sloped,
or
inverted
yield
curve.
When
long-term
rates
are
much
higher
than
short-term
rates,
the
yield
curve
is
steep.
When
long-term
rates
are
virtually
the
same
as
short-term
rates,
the
yield
curve
is
flat.

Yield
curve
twist
A
phrase
used
to
describe
changes
in
prevailing
interest
rates
that
change
the
shape/slope
of
the
yield
curve.
For
example,
a
small
increase
in
short-term
rates
and
a
large
increase
in
lon-
term
rates
that
occur
at
the
same
time.
A
manifestation
of
yield
curve
risk.
Yield
to
call
(YTC)
The
annual
percentage
yield
of
a
security
calculated
using
the
yield-to-maturity
formula
but
with
the
assumption
that
the
security
is
called
on
the
first
call
date
or
on
the
first
par
call
date.
Yield-to-maturity
(YTM)
The
annual
percentage
yield
of
a
security
calculated
in
a
specific
manner.
The
yield-to-maturity
is
the
single
discount
rate
that,
when
applied
to
all
future
interest
and
principal
payments,
produces
a
net
present
value
equal
to
the
purchase
price
of
the
security.

Z
bond
See
Z
tranche.
Z
score
One
of
the
oldest
and
most
well-known
insolvency
prediction
formulas.
The
Z
score,
developed
by
Dr.
Robert
Altman,
is
a
financial
model
that
uses
historical
financial
data
to
calculate
a
score.
The
Z
score
successfully
predicts
bankruptcy
with
well
over
90
percent
accuracy
using
data
from
one
year
prior
and
is
over
70
percent
accurate
using
data
from
as
many
as
five
years
prior
to
bankruptcy.
Other
financial
models
claim
even
higher
accuracy
levels.
Z
tranche
A
Z
tranche
is
a
CMO
tranche.
With
the
exception
of
jump
Z
tranches,
owners
of
the
Z
tranche
receive
no
cash
flow
from
underlying
mortgage
collateral
until
the
other
tranches
are
retired.
During
the
period
when
other
tranches
are
still
outstanding,
the
owners
of
the
Z
tranche
receive
credit
for
periodic
interest.
Those
credits
increase
the
face
value
of
the
tranche
but
are
not
paid
to
the
owners.
The
Z
bond
may
be,
but
does
not
have
to
be,
the
last
tranche
in
a
CMO
structure
that
is
retired.
Sometimes
called
an
accretion
bond
or
an
accrual
bond.
ZBA
See
zero-balance
account.
Zero
cost
collar
The
purchase
of
a
floor
(or
cap)
option
with
the
proceeds
realized
from
simultaneous
sale
of
a
cap
(or
floor)
option.
The
levels
of
the
floor
and
cap
are
selected
so
that
the
proceeds
from
the
option
sold
exactly
offset
the
cost
of
the
option
purchased
resulting
in
a
net
transaction
cost
of
zero.
See
cap,
collar
and
floor.
Zero
coupon
bond
A
type
of
debt
security
that
does
not
pay
periodic
interest.
Zero
coupon
securities
are
bought
and
sold
at
prices
that
are
less
than
the
par
value
of
the
securities.
The
discount,
or
difference
between
the
principal
paid
to
purchase
the
security
and
the
principal
returned
at
maturity,
constitutes
the
investor's
return.

Zero-balance
account
(ZBA)
A
cash
management
service
offered
by
banks.
A
bank
checking
account
that
can
accept
deposits
and/or
make
disbursements
but
that
is
always
maintained
at
a
zero
balance.
The
zero
balance
is
maintained
by
transferring
just
enough
funds
from
or
to
a
concentration
account
to
offset
each
day’s
activity.
The
concentration
account
is
sometimes
called
the
parent
account
and
the
zero-balance
account
is
sometimes
called
the
daughter
or
subsidiary
account.

of
use
and
the
density
of
development
permitted
